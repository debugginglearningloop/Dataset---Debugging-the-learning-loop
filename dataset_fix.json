        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm looking for the best way to expose a public API endpoint that makes calls to an LLM. A few key requirements:\n\n- **Streaming support**: Responses need to be streamed for a better UX.\n\n- **Security & abuse protection**: Needs to be protected against abuse (rate limiting, authentication, etc.).\n\n- **Scalability**: Should handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.\n\n\nI initially tried Google Cloud Run with Google API Gateway, but I couldn't get streaming to work properly. Are there better alternatives that support streaming out of the box and offer good security features?\n\nWould love to hear what has worked for you!\n\n",

Humans are still way ahead of them.\n\nAI has a tendency to hallucinate to the point of suggesting things that simply do not exist (at least for the language chosen).\n\nGenerations of programmers learnt before AI and even before the internet was a thing.\n\nOne problem with AI tutors is also that it is too easy to abuse them to give direct solutions, which, effectively, hinders the learning process. You don't learn much from reading code as you only see the final product, but not the design and manufacturing process, which actually is what counts.\n\nCode is like a finished novel. You can read and understand novels, but just through reading them, you won't become enabled to write them. You need to write, to design, to plan your programs to learn.\n\nEven if your solutions are far from good or optimal, that's the learning process. Create a solution and analyse it. Find bottlenecks. Find weaknesses. Fix them. Refactor. Improve.",

        "selftext": "To start this post off, I would like to mention I am a complete beginner to coding as a whole and the only programming language I have \"learned\" is python. I say learned lightly as I have learned loops, functions, classes although I haven't put those into practice quite yet, lists and dictionaries, and pretty much any of the very basics.\n\nSo I am wanting to create a little \"AI\" assistant kind of thing just as a hobby project. I'm hesitant to call what I want to make an AI but basically I want to make something that will eventually be able listen to voice commands and perform basic tasks based off of the voice input.\n\nWhat I really want to do is more complicated. I want to create a little pixel art character that sits on the bottom right of the screen to go along with the AI. It's theme is going to be about a book series I am reading where the characters can advance in rank. To integrate that into the project, I plan on making a todo list or something, and every task I manage to complete is \"experience\" added to the little character. Once it reaches a max progression state, the character is stored elsewhere (Haven't figured out what I want to do with that yet) and a new character with a randomized appearance is created. Then the cycle would continue over and over.\n\nIt might seem like an ambitious project but I don't plan on this taking a week or two. I know it will take me much longer with how much there is to learn and how much time I have available. This project isn't to just make something I find cool although that is a major part of it... But I plan on chunking it out into much more manageable pieces so that I can still feel accomplished after completing a task.\n\nI'm making this post because I want all the advice I could possibly get on any subject you might think is relevant. For example, right now I'm struggling to figure out how I would go about displaying the little character on the bottom right of my screen without impeding any actions I want to take on my desktop. Right now my plan is to learn PyQT5 so that I can make a new window/gui with a transparent background that my character will sit within. I have no idea if PyQT5 is a good resource for this and I haven't started the learning process but that's my focus for now. Like I said, I will take all the advice I can get. If you want to direct me to a resource that I can learn from that would be awesome too. Anything helps!",

I’m a first-year software engineering student, and this is my first time having a PC.\n\nFor three years, I studied web development without practicing because I didn’t have a PC. Now, I struggle to code on my own—I rely on AI, tutorials, or copying code without understanding concepts like APIs or servers.\n\nI only have four months to improve while studying advanced topics with my friends at university, like PC architecture, multimedia, Java, JavaScript, networks, cloud, Unix, and compilation, etc., and I feel like I don’t have the fundamentals. When I study, I think about everything individually, without seeing the whole picture of how it all works together.\n\nDo I need to solve problems on platforms like LeetCode in C++ to understand memory management and become a better programmer? Should I focus on problem-solving in JavaScript because I’m going to study it? If I do that, will I miss the practice of pointers and memory management that C++ offers?\n\nPeople always say coding isn’t about memorizing syntax, so when I solve problems, what should I focus on? Can software engineers code without copying and pasting or relying on tutorials? How can I get out of tutorial hell and start coding independently while managing my studies?\n\nThe topics I’m learning are very advanced, and I feel like I lack the fundamentals. How can I manage everything, pass exams, complete advanced projects, and also code on my own? Please help me with tips.\n\nI’m really sad, sorry for all the questions—I just need advice.",

Analyze the output, make an effort to understand the code, try to see if there are gaps not covered by AI, ask them why, etc.",

        "selftext": "I am honestly at the point where I think it would be downright disrespectful to show up tomorrow.   \n  \nI am a part of this program that helps you get a front-end developer job. Just what you'd expect, you do tasks, then projects, then start applying. I started using AI towards the beginning of my journey and it really screwed me. Once I got to harder problems it felt impossible for me to solve them without AI and the time constraints to complete these tasks made it nearly impossible for me to not rely on it at that point. This pressure made me continue using it till this day. \n\nFast forward and I have created a whole NextJS front-end application(basically following figma designs provided by my program) that netted me the interview. But I dont know ANYTHING about the logic behind it. API calls, user registration etc. I can kind of guess what the code means and follow it somewhat but I wouldnt be able to arrive at that myself. I guess I am okay at html and css/tailwind but my javascript is literally beginners level. I can only do loops and basic conditionals. \n\nI am now in a situation where I have to get a job within a couple of weeks or move back to the US. I have no trust that I will and will probably have to look into a different career.   \n  \nLet me be an example for those who are just starting out. You dont think its a big deal at first and if used sparingly, but eventually you get way too comfortable using it. Not only is it bad for you but I'm sure you will also have a worse experience and less fun in the process. ",

I think with the bottom code it's assuming that each individual pointer also points to a dynamically allocated Object. If that's the case delete\\[\\] objects would only destroy and unallocate the array of pointers, and not the data being pointed to by each pointer. It would depend I guess on how and where you allocate the data for the Object class and how you manage its destructor which doesn't seem to be specified in your post.\n\nBut, yah, this is the sort of reason why modern C++ favors the use of vectors and smart pointers over raw pointers and arrays. RAII is your friend. Your code also demonstrates how raw pointers can create clarity and readability issues. When used for a dynamic data member there's no immediate context as to whether \\*\\* refers to a single pointer to a pointer, an array of pointers, or an array of arrays.",

Actually I'm involved in a project which is about internal A.I. tools right now.\n\nAnd to be honest I think A.I. really helped me with understanding stuff which I always had a hard time with. For example I wrote a test website, but by asking \"how can I make this better\" I learned a lot of new things, which neither courses, nor classes, gave me. Especially when it comes to conventions or maintainability.\n\nIt feels like training wheels and over time I learn more and more new stuff, while I'm able to integrate everything previously learned. Without asking again.\n\nAlso it's great that you can ask whatever you want, no matter how stupid and if it was a dumb question you barely wasted time, didn't stop a class and all the consequences are thoughts like \"damn, I should have known that\".\n\nOf course just asking for code without further questions doesn't help. A.I. code starts out as mostly working, but it needs to be refined a lot in order to actually be maintainable.\n\nI refactored the A.I. code multiple times. And I think my commenting also improved, the next thing I'm doing is integrating JSDoc, by using a mix of A.I. and documentation.",

                "body": "I don't recommend using Copilot or any AI assistant in your IDE or code editor to help you code while you're learning. It ends up being a crutch, you'll rely on it and you won't be able to write code without it.\n\nThis is especially important because AI is not perfect. It's quite good at writing beginner-level code, but as your code gets more complex, it will make more and more mistakes. If you don't know how to code it without AI, and AI makes a mistake, then you'll really be stuck.\n\nFor experienced programmers, this isn't an issue. I know exactly what I want to write. AI can save me time typing it out, but I can verify that it's correct, and catch any subtle mistakes.\n\nThat doesn't mean you should throw out all AI. I think one thing LLMs like ChatGPT are very good at is explaining error messages. Let's say you wrote some code and it fails with an error message, but you don't understand it. Copy and paste all of your code and the error message and it can often help explain it in great detail, helping you fix it. I think that's totally reasonable for a beginner, but the important thing is that you tried to write it yourself first.\n\nOverall the best way to learn to code from scratch is to pick a good complete course and work your way through it from start to finish, doing all of the exercises yourself without using AI. Ask AI or ask people questions about things that you tried that don't work, but don't ask for answers or you'll never learn it.",

If you’re trying to understand a problem and need an explanation on how to approach it that could be great for learning. Just make sure you actually read and try and understand and ask more questions to break it down. It’s no different than asking a teacher or teaching assistant or senior dev for help. I took CS50x from Harvard which is their intro to programming and the teacher starts out with, “Look AI is going no where. We’ve decided to use our own version as a rubber duck to help you think not just give you the answer”. Now if you’re just using it to give you an answer and not think about it twice then yeah it could lead you to being over reliant on the tool and not thinking.",

So you can build knowledge about the features already existing in the ide. Features that don't hallucinate,  like: simple autocomplete with reference is generally very helpful to auto import things... That's a point that we lose a lot of time with copilot for example: it hallucinate and the dev didn't see that the thing is wrong but believes it's not wrong because it's looking good. And you start losing time because you didn't thought at each step what you were looking for. Generally just typing things, the ide will spell the most probable thing to you.\n\nI do use it extensively for little auto complete and some big completions. It is efficient. But it requires me to over think what it wrote for me. It's more energy for me to ensure it's right.\n\nAlso I didn't ban it in my team, but I do feel frustrated seeing how much it drains time during development of easy things just because it just went its own way.\n\nYou can use it for explaining things and kick start some explorative work. But that's like talking to someone that isn't more intelligent than you, just quicker to remember things. This is a hard nuance to understand. This tool is dumb.

I know how it works, heck, I implemented the mechanism piece by piece in pytorch (based on papers) and yeah, it's true that it's pretty much an autocomplete and it's insane that it works at all.\n\nHowever I don't think GPTs can be described as \"smart\" or \"dumb\".

                                "body": "There are too many points for me to answer here. I'll pick up what I can:\n\nI don't want to describe a lifeless tool with an adjective we use for life behavior (without starting the whole semantics discussion there is behind those very blurry words). People forget it's a tool and use it thinking it's smart. It's smartly written. It can be smartly used. People using it may be smart. In the context I used I said that it's like talking with a person. I can understand why it can be confusing, communication is not always my strong point.\n\nYou mainly ask how to approach this tool to improve yourself and get more efficiency out of it.\n\nThe thing is, learning CS is the same as everything. You have to do it, yourself, with your hands, with your time and with your energy. It's important to do so. Because while doing it you feel what the work is, your brain ingests the knowledge and opens doors (ideas, questions, answers...). How tedious it is to repeat always the same thing, how tedious it is to test things, how tedious it is to have a bug in production you don't find because you lack monitoring and/or tests.\n\nYou have to go through it. That's the point of learning.\n\nUsing an AI tool, it will take this experience and sum it up in an answer that is a few paragraph long. But the thing is, there is an actual encyclopedia behind it. And you actually miss it. So you can't actually check that what it is saying is right at all. Your brain can't ingest anything of this encyclopedia and just take the answers for granted. No critical thinking is coming out of it.\n\nWe can take a simple example. You want to be an Olympic runner. You find running tedious and there is this Uber tool to put on your shoes so it does most of the job for you. So you run with it. Your muscles won't do the actual job. And when you remove the device, you'll have invested a lot of time in running but having less than 10% efficiency on what you were looking for.\n\nIt's efficient when you know how to run and your muscles are trained. Then it lifts you some weight and allows you to go to other extents.\n\nThere is no passing practice. You have to go through it.\n\nNow, how I think it's practical:\n\n- ask it how to do things, for different solutions. Quick assessment of pros and cons of solutions to help you decide what you actually need. It's helpful on doing Google search quicker than me and sum up the knowledge out of it. I still need to check if it didn't hallucinate or if it took up to date knowledge.\n\n- help on kick-start tasks. How to set up this or that. But I still do it by myself. And I check the documentation to be sure I am still following the right way with the nuances I require for my context. Like, I need to inject this CSV file into this db for a one time script. It'll write most of it, giving you a generally good enough solution. (In the runner device exemple, we can see how this device could be used to help someone disable for a long time to kick start their muscle and the training, but at some point if everything goes well, the device must be gone)\n\n- auto completes: when I am clearly stating what I am doing (variable/function names), the tool generally gets it right and offers a solution. Now, this is the ideal situation. Because in reality, I will use different words to describe the operation I have to do because I am on different layers (some technical, some business). This depends on the architecture of the project. And this is a domain of freedom for devs. We always have the possibility to add our own \"thing\" to accommodate our problems. And for a whole lot of reasons, the auto complete is generally when you are not in the ideal situation. It learnt on actual written code. But it helps you while writing the code. Not quite the same thing in the end. When I write code, I explore the problem I am solving. My first lines won't matter that much in the end. Or maybe they will. Nothing is certain while you're not finished. So I am generally at the end of the clear solution when it can actually understand what I writing. This happens a lot in legacy systems (which we have to maintain a lot in our job).\n\n\nThere are too many problems in a transient way and I already burnt a lot of my energy to write this. Sorry for not being strong enough and carry on but I think this is a thesis subject at this point.",

It wasn't written by ChatGPT, but I used ChatGPT find sources and to grasp everything. Oh and for learning pytorch (at that point I only used tensorflow, which I pretty much dropped by now).\n\nIt still took over 400 hours to complete. ChatGPT probably also contributed to this, because it was easy to find many sources and I went really deep into it due to that, especially when it came to influential papers. Every single point I wrote came from a paper or book (except for my own experiments).\n\nHowever you're right, this absolutely could be a thesis subject. I can't back my point with data, only my personal experience, which might or might not be misleading and we should end it here.\n\nBut I'm really thankful for the exchange!",

I'm diving into two exciting but separate worlds: developing an AI-powered voice assistant using Python and Vosk, and exploring cybersecurity basics with tools like Kali Linux. While the AI focuses on natural language processing, transcription, and interaction, my cybersecurity journey is helping me grasp network scanning and ethical hacking concepts. Any tips on improving in either field? I'd love advice on building efficient APIs, voice recognition, or understanding vulnerability scans.

I’m working on creating my portfolio, and I often need to figure out how to complete various tasks. For example, I created a REST controller that accepts information about a new user. It’s validated using pre-made functions, but I also need to ensure that the user is over 18. I couldn’t find a pre-made annotation for this, so I first asked AI about its name and then how to create one. Another thing I usually ask for is what is a new name of the class. For instance, I found a tutorial on JWT authentication, but it used an older version of the framework, so some code was not working. I always make sure I understand not only the code from tutorials/chaGpt, but idea behind it too, at least I believe in that. But could I rewrite it after a week? Probably not",

Code is only the final result, not the path.\n\nYou need to learn to focus on the path, not on the goal.",

U ask AI it gives 1 option and if it suitable - fine, no u explain where is the problem or why u don't like it and then ask for other one and repeat. From positive sites is that u can always make arguments with it: u propose yours idea, ask why it can't be done thos way and so on",

If you encounter that problem again having used AI, there's a good chance you won't remember how to solve it, and will waste all that time again (at least that's what I found in myself).\n\nIf you're facing simple debugging problems and can't solve them without GPT, you've been using it as a crutch.

Since you're just a freshman learning basic concepts, GPT is probably pretty accurate actually, but it's not something you'll be able to rely on later on and therefore you should avoid becoming too comfortable with it, imo.\n\nInstead, it's better to just try to understand the lecture material and/or provided material (recorded lectures, textbooks, documentation, etc...), and use chatgpt to clarify parts of the material when it's hard to digest or hard to understand.",

ChatGPT became nearly useless after a week of learning.\n\nChatGPT frequently forgot to mention important features of the framework. Sometimes forgetting and implementing them itself - badly. \n\nEventually, I stopped asking for help when it started to try and design convoluted tables structures for the underlying database. Suggesting making two extra tables rather than building a simple many-to-many relationship using Django’s through feature. \n\nI don’t deny it might have boosted my learning through the very basics, but it could only go so far before it was out of its depth. \n\nIn my experience this relegates ChatGPT to an extremely advanced search engine.\n\nFor example when I was in my first job as a programmer (2011-ish) I was looking for something that can save a program’s objects to a database. I could not find it on Google because I didn’t know how to formulate the correct terms. I had to find out about ORMs speaking with colleagues. ChatGPT has made that kind of search easier and it can even give a few links to help you dive deeper as well as very basic tips on implementation. \n\nNow when I use ChatGPT I always ask for sources to learn more about the topic. This has lead me to quality resources that have the necessary context for learning good habits.  \n\nI like your idea of asking it for help to lead you through a topic, but be mindful that it’s constructing answers word by word probabilistically. Because of this I frequently run into issues where it makes basic mistakes on how the different APIs work in Python. Sometimes even hallucinating methods that don’t exist. ",

If I see a word , eg:  \"attachment\" , I open up dictionary and look at the meaning of it.\n\nWhere and how to apply the word is another thing altogether. That requires me to learn language grammar. I can't say I attachment the item to the package. It should be I have attached the item to the package.\n\nSo if you want to know what is a for loop and an example , pls go ahead and ask.\n\nBut if you blindly copy that for loop code in your program whereas it requires a while loop then thats your problem for not understanding the program/language/syntax.\n\nNothing to do with AI.",

Ive been keeping up on the papers and I know about the way the model architecture is changing. I have trained a lot of models, cleaned a lot of data, and used various LLMs extensively from an end user/code assistant perspective. \n\nI also know very well that more data and more compute make better models.. with enough TPUs, power, and code to train on, not many people will need to be actually writing code within a decade or so. Microsoft didn’t buy GitHub for the lols\n\nHave you used ChatGPT 4o Canvas? have you used the o1 preview? It’s only a matter of time before all the computer jobs are erased from the labour market in favour of models finetuned for specific tasks. \n\nThe leaps and bounds in AI since the release of 3.5 are immense. The hype from non technical people outpaces the change sometimes, yes. But with Canvas and some smart prompt engineering, ChatGPT can comfortably keep 100ish lines of code in context, which is far better than it was doing a year or two years ago. Soon it’ll be a thousand, then thousands, then entire large codebases. \n\nI’m not saying there aren’t issues. Currently you still need to know how to code to be able to catch things that went wrong. but if you look at the analysis of the models on various standardized testing, it’s clear that soon they will be better than most humans at most tasks from just a _generalized_ model without fine tuning. Currently the good ones sit at like the 90th (human) percentile for things like the LSATs etc. it won’t be long until they’re 99.99th across the board. \n\nWhen I ask Chat to do something, does it always do what I would have done? No. But it gives me code that someone else might have written for me and I fix it up from there as needed. When learning, there’s absolutely no problem to use ChatGPT. You might as well not use Stackoverflow if you’re trying to make sure you’re not ‘cheating’ your learning or whatever",

Yes I've used ChatGPT extensively and yes it has helped me tremendously. It's impressive technology, no doubt. But the point i was getting at is that you believe it will replace us soon and I'd argue that is still very far into the future if at all. LLMs shine in analyzing language and matching patterns, but it's not really 'thinking'. It lacks self-reflection, the ability to generalize concepts and apply it to a wider range of fields and it lacks the ability to reason about new concepts. There is a prominent future for this technology, but I'd strongly argue replacing developers isn't where it's headed currently. It's headed towards a strongly intertwined cooperation between the two. We are still magnitudes away from GAI (if it is even possible). Until then our job's workflow and ways we tackle problems might evolve significantly, but AI won't replace us any time soon.",

Your mind has a hard time putting it all together.\n\nHere's a different approach.  Build the program incrementally.   \n\nI'll start with an analogy.   You want to run a catering company but you've never done it before.   You know that vaguely you need to figure out what food to make, how to make it in quantity, how to store it in refrigeration for a while, how to bring heat lamps and warming pans, how to hire staff, how to transport it to the venue, how to serve people, how to clean up, how to take all that back to where you work, how to wash everything and put stuff away.\n\nYou might have no idea how to manage that entire process.   So, you start with, how to make the dishes to be served.   Initially, you do it at a small scale, for 2-3 people.   Then, you figure out how you might do it for 10 people, then 50-100.   It might be, the recipes you come up with don't do well in large quantities.  Maybe it's too complex a recipe.\n\nAfter you solve that problem, you might think about how to store the food until the catering even so it doesn't go bad.\n\nThe point is: you don't have to figure everything out.\n\nRead the assignment.   Figure out what you can do now.  For things that require more thought, maybe solve something simpler first.  Work it out on paper before you start coding.  By that, I mean draw pictures.  Maybe draw an array.   Figure out how the program should behave with certain inputs.  What are the expected outputs given those inputs?\n\nTo summarize, don't do the entire program at once.  Think about the first thing you can get done, e.g., read in some input values.  Figure out how to solve the problem without a program.  How would you do it if someone asked you to do it instead of writing a program that does it.  \n\nFor example, if you can't do matrix multiplication on paper, you won't be able to write a program that does matrix multiplication.   But once you can do it, think about the steps that need to happen.  What are the steps you're doing on paper?   How do you translate that to a program?   That becomes a problem of nested loops over two 2D arrays.   Some problems are difficult not because of the programming, but because of the math or physics.  Unfortunately, some teachers give assignments that are math-heavy and so you're having to solve two problems: writing a program and doing the math.\n\nThis approach will lead to writing the code, rewriting it, so it might lead to something a bit messy, but learning to rewrite code is useful.  You don't have to craft everything and get it working the first time.  Even experienced programmers don't always get it right.  It takes a lot of fixing bugs and testing, even if you've done it many times before.",

Or am I the modern equivalent of the dude saying \"IDEs and autocomplete will make you lazy\"?

        "selftext": "Hey, I created a mini geography trivia game online using CSS, HTML and JS. It's really simple and straight forward. Each day the player gets a set of clues that help them figure out the answer. Every day I have to manually code in the clues and the answer.\n\nWhat would be the next step if I wanted to use the chatGPT API to automatically come up with clues and an answer every day? I'm having a hard time figuring out the next step since I can't use the API key in a visible project. Any help of how to move my project over to somewhere where I can incorporate their API into a \"backend\" would be great, but don't know what to do exactly.\n\nthe game is [here](https://emilehicksonx.github.io/GuessTheLocation/) and the GitHub pages repo is [here](https://github.com/emilehicksonx/GuessTheLocation). Please ignore any bad coding practices or failures to follow best practices 😂\n\nI hope that makes sense and thanks for any answers!",

It’s just you and your code and even that’s a lot to handle when you’re just starting out. \n2. It encourages good typing technique. If you have to type everything by hand you’re going to want to learn how to do it well. \n3. You experience the full value of concise labels. If the editor fills in things after a few characters it’s easy to forget that. \n4. The idea of those tools being taken away from you won’t bother you. Idk if this happens in programming but I’ve seen this kind of thing happen in other places. People get so reliant on help that they can’t actually manage their task on their own. \n6. If you type everything yourself, you’re probably going to cause a lot of no such errors, missing symbol errors, etc. These are very easy to find and fix. That makes them good ways to learn about debugging.",

                "body": "While I agree with others, I would also say, that you could utilize AI after you already complete some fundamental task. Maybe not the autocompletion AI per se, but you could always plug the code you've came up with into chat/claude (this one seems to have better opinions in terms of programming), and:  \n\\- describe what you've tried to do - describe it as precisely as possible, so you eliminate the room for ambiguousness,  \n\\- ask what could be done differently,  \n\\- is there a built-in API that does what you've done by hand etc,\n\nUse it as a reviewer, as a way of exploring and possibly brainstorming rather than replacing the skill of solving the problems on your own. In the end, programmers who know how to code have a better reasoning about the code AI outputs, as they can look at it while having the big picture - how maintainable it looks, does it suit the project you're building/working with. Essentially, this is what other in this thread are telling - focus on the basics, gain the big picture, and once you feel comfortable try to incorporate these tools into your workflow. If you feel that they're doing too much, this might be not the moment to incorporate them yet.\n\nSince you're learning you could also utilize it as a teacher - given you described what you wanted to do quite precisely (and this is especially hard when being a beginner) you could ask it to give you an additional task to make your code more robust, ask about what edge cases you missed in your implementation and treat it as an additional exercise. Tip here is to add to prompt to \"not output the code, just the tasks\", so you're forced to solve it on your own first.\n\nThe tools are for use. The same reason one uses calculator - to ease his working. But as with calculator you have to know at least the basics, the same stands with using AI for programming - you need to know the basics.\n\nTL:DR: Relying on AI without knowing the programming concepts can lead you into a bad, unmaintainable code, and won't encourage you to explore it further since \"it works and you're satisfied\". If you know programming you can make better judgements about the output of these tools - but this comes only with experience.",

Its just like following a coding tutorial but save more time, u can always ask it if u dont understand or visit youtube for furthuer explaination.

Being stuck in tutorial hell means that you cannot take the thing you should have learned in the tutorial and apply them to your own projects. Every time you want to do something new/different you cannot do it on your own and you have to look at a tutorial for it.  \nThe correct thing to do is to look at a tutorial and change it and adapt it to fit into your project. That way you use a tutorial as a jumping of point and continue with using the documentation. That is how you get out of tutorial hell. (By the way, experienced devs do this to expect the don't call it a tutorial but a \"getting started\" guide).\n\nA written tutorial or a video will teach you one exact thing. If you want to change it you are forced to adapt the tutorial to fit your needs. With llm you can just ask the model for the different thing you want to do. There is no need to learn what the llm tries to teach you because you can just ask the other thing. There is a danger that extensive use of llms will not teach you anything.",

I also have some basic coding knowledge and an understanding of web architecture but wouldn’t consider myself technical. \n\nMy goal is to build a SaaS product, but I’m torn between two paths:\n\n1. Going all-in on no-code tools like [Toddle](https://toddle.dev/), which would let me build fully functioning web apps on my own,\n2. Or learning AI-assisted coding with tools like Replit and Cursor, which could help me get up to speed with coding.\n\nHere’s the thing: I know there are tons of people with far more technical expertise, so I’m not sure if it makes sense to learn coding when I could focus on no-code and play to my strengths of marketing and product management. \n\nI worry that learning coding might leave me stuck at MVPs, whereas no-code could help me build full products faster and reduce my reliance on CTO/dev if I don't have access to one. \n\nOf course, hiring technical help in the future is the wise choice but I want to have that flexibility to be able to deploy full fledged micro saas products and stay lean if i want to (indie hacker)\n\nMy plan for the next 6 months is to learn and build small projects as practice before I start validating and building my SaaS idea.\n\nGiven that **(tldr)**, should I focus on learning no-code for speed and independence or try AI-assisted coding to keep my options open for more custom builds? Which option would you suggest given my situation?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Why?\"\n\nAnd they ask me as though, when AI couldn't fill in the gaps in their understanding, I was supposed to do it instead. They weren't using AI to learn. They used it as a means to an end, and that end being working code rather than functional understanding of the language. \n\nThat isn't a useful way to use AI, in my opinion.

One thing that stood out to me as something I hadn't considered which seemed obvious after the fact was the violation of basic software principles like DRY, which is something I've noticed in my own use, with copilot duplicating already existing functionality. https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality\n\nI would not pay for it personally, but I get it free. I've also experimented with Continue and a local code-focused model like DeepSeekCoder to good effect so that might be a suitable budget-focused alternative if SOTA performance is not paramount.\n\nIf you are learning programming turn the AI assistant off and use LLM's more like google, I don't hate AI at all but I am very worried about it ruining an entire generation of programmers.

There are a lot of non-dev, like network engineer, data scientist, .. that are able to find their way through. We are able to let simple task to bad devs and give more time to good ones.\n\nThey gave github copilot to a whole team in india with low salaries so that the engineers here can do other stuff more worth their salaries. Still, 1 of them is still almost 100% of his time reviewing and fixing the indian's team code. They also fired people, that's all corporates' dream, they did fire some good devs that was paid too much, but they mostly fired the less efficient devs. Btw, I don't really care, I am not a \"AI will steal our jobs\" guy, but that's the reality behind it and the reason why big corporate says that developer is a dead job: to sell more.\n\nI beg to differ on git. Bad devs hated it and still do. The reason is because of the complexity and that's why they are avoiding direct contact with it. Even among those who use it in the CLI, most of them barely know clone/pull/push and merge/rebase without knowing the difference. Git liking is and always was a matter of skill.\n\nAnd most of the things you mentionned were overly and badly used. OOP has good sides, but there are still so many devs that don't understand that mere free function make sense.\n\n\nTL;DR: AI is good for things you are bad at and don't want to progress on. You will have a clear distinction between the devs (rare, skilled and highly paid) and the AI users (out-sourced and badly paid).",

I can tell it what I want, or I can provide a sample in one language, and it will translate that into this language, and usually does a very good job with that.\n\nDon't blindly accept the results, but rather validate them and/or learn from them, and I'd say it's definitely worth the price.",

                "body": "It's easy to think of Chat GPT like Google.  It's not.  Think of it more like asking your friend, who is a programmer, for help.  You say, hey read my code and fix it up and explain it.  Does that help you learn?\n\nTo give an analogy, suppose you wanted to learn how to tell jokes.  Someone gives you a situation like, tell me a joke about a cat and a dog on a stranded island.  But, your joke doesn't work, so you ask a friend who is good at jokes.  They tell a joke, explain it, and you laugh, and then they ask you to give another joke.\n\nIf you can tell another joke, great, but if you still have issues and you need to ask every time, that's a problem.\n\nThis isn't to say Chat GPT is useless to learn.  But you should use it more like \"I don't understand how loops work, can you show me an example\" rather than \"My code doesn't do this, can you fix it for me and explain where it went wrong\".  I mean, you *can* do that too, but I would immediately delete the code after you read it and understand it, and do the same problem from scratch.\n\nYou really see if you do understand it when the answer isn't staring you off the laptop screen.\n\nIf you delete it, and your brain freezes, this means you are able to understand things (like when you watch a movie), but not able to form these thoughts in your head (like when you're asked to make your own movie).   Programming requires some thought in your head.\n\nNow, you don't need to do everything from scratch and never look anything up, but you need to understand the basic structure.  A good analogy of this is visiting a country where you don't speak the language.  You may know what you want to say in English, but you have no idea how to say it in French.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, it's more like, you know you need to open a file, process line by line, check for this or that, and do this or that.  That is, you think in pseudocode.  You may not know how to translate that pseudcode fully into code, so you can look that up.\n\nBut you should know the basics.  If I ask you to show me how a loop works, you should be able to do that.  If I ask you to explain recursion, you should be able to do that.  If I ask you some basic questions about an array, you should be able to do that.  If I ask you to write a program that plays chess, well, that's really hard, so I wouldn't expect you to know how to do that.\n\nIt's pretty hard to describe what you ought to know and have committed to memory (so to speak) and what it's not worth remembering in detail.",

Anectdotally in experiments at my job, ChatGPT gives a simply factually incorrect answer about 50% of the time. For more basic stuff, that ratio is probably better. But ChatGPT is still quite dumb.\n\n\nSecond, amd more importantly, using it while learning deprives you of skill building. As a professional developer your goal isn't skill building, it's solving problems. In that world, using an AI tool (carefully) is a good idea. But as a learner, you need the struggle of finding your own answer to learn. ",

        "selftext": "LLMs are impressive, but they're not a magic bullet. They're tools, and like any tool, they have their limitations.\n\nI've seen a lot of hype around LLMs and their potential to revolutionize software development. People claim they've become 10x more productive thanks to tools like Copilot and Codeium. This leads me to think that i am simply not using it right because I am not getting the same results as them.\n\nSure, they can be helpful for tasks like recalling specific syntax or when you wanna center a div. But as soon as you start dealing with complex, custom problems or large codebases, these models start to falter. They can generate code that's syntactically correct but semantically flawed. And the time spent fixing these errors often outweighs any perceived benefits.\n\nPersonally, I find these code assistants more of a hindrance than a help. I've spent countless hours debugging and refactoring code generated by LLMs. It's often faster and more reliable to simply write the code myself. I have been using these tools for personal projects as well as work, but I prefer to keep AI suggestions turned off. It disturbs my workflow more than helping it.\n\nThe truth is, that most engineers are capable of solving complex programming problems without relying on LLMs. It's often just a matter of breaking down the problem, thinking creatively, and implementing a solution. Sure, LLMs can help with specific tasks, but they're not going to replace human ingenuity.\n\nSo let's be realistic about the capabilities of LLMs. They're powerful tools, but they're not a solution. They're not going to make you a 10x better developer. They're just another tool.",

It's like I have a junior engineer sitting and just waiting for me to tell it to do something tedious... then it magically does that something in seconds instead of hours.  Badly and in need of review, but 50 tests that just need tweaking is better than having to write 50 tests from scratch.\n\nArguably, I got 10x return when toying around with Rust.  I don't really know Rust very well, so I could lean on the LLM for syntax and for borrow-related questions.\n\nBut if I'm being honest, the real problem is \"typing up code, trivial documentation, and fixing easy bugs\" is usually less than half of what you do as a programmer.  That's what LLMs do fast (not well, just fast).  But even if they get you 90% savings on that (not reasonable IMO), you're still less than 2x faster overall.  LLMs fail miserably at solving \"obscure bugs that take you days of staring at your code\", and they can't prioritize features for you, and they can't really code review someone's code.  They can't go in and flesh out a badly-written bug ticket to provide replication.  And so on.  And so forth.",

Homing in on what the issue is quickly and get to relevant information quickly is a sign of seniority and the only way you’re going to get better at it is by doing it. \n\nMany senior developers have spent countless hours reading stuff that ultimately led to nowhere. That is not wasted time. They still learned about auxilliary issues, how they went down the wrong path, how they got back to the correct one and what they can do better next time. \n\nI will echo the original post, AI is just a tool, not a substitute for certain requirements for being a good engineer.

Use it as a way to find the holes and not for plugging them. Plug them yourself.",

I hope you find it enjoyable.\n\nRegarding your use case of large language models (LLMs) for explaining how something is used in a particular context, I completely agree. One of the best applications of these models is in streamlining the process of navigating extensive documentation. No one wants to spend hours sifting through pages just to find a small piece of information. This is where LLMs truly shine—by summarizing and clarifying content that would otherwise be time-consuming to search through manually.\n\nHowever, I want to point out some significant drawbacks of LLMs, especially for engineers and developers. In my experience, these models are not reliable for code generation. They often produce incorrect solutions, hallucinate, and even when I correct them, they persist in generating even worse code. I've spent hours fixing code that LLMs generated, and in hindsight, doing it myself would have been much faster.\n\nI've now limited my use of LLMs to generating documentation for my code, and even then, I find myself having to explain a lot to them. While these models are a powerful tool, my advice to beginners is not to rely on them for tasks that require problem-solving skills. Over-reliance on LLM-generated code can give a false sense of dependency, which is counterproductive in the long run.",

They say \"I understand the solution, but my mind goes blank when I have to come up with my own solution\".  I'm not sure they re-read written content or re-watch the videos.\n\nReading or watching can be a very passive experience.  For example, if you see some code with a loop in it to solve some simple problem, then you close the video, would you recall what the video said?  You need to have some basic recall, otherwise, your mind will go blank.\n\nWatching things doesn't mean you can recall it.  With technical jargon, it can be hard to recall.\n\nI suspect many beginners blank out, have no idea what to do, then go to Chat GPT and then wonder \"Why couldn't I think of it?\".\n\nThe idea is to make your brain think of these solutions as you watch them in video or read them in books.  Imagine you had to explain the same concepts to a friend who is just starting out.  What would you say?  If it's nothing, then it's not fully in your brain.  It's only passively there, not actively there.",

        "selftext": "8 months ago, I began learning programming (frontend). I started with HTML/CSS/JS, then moved on to React and Next.js. After completing various tutorials, to-do lists, and similar projects, I started working on my own projects. I really enjoyed it, but as my projects became more complex, I found myself increasingly relying on ChatGPT—not just to explain code, but eventually to write code for me as well. I feel like this might be impacting my learning curve, even though I'm able to create cool apps and debugging (since AI can only do about 80% of the work and then gets stuck) helps me understand the code better. I also start reading the docs more sinds it is harder for ChatGPT to (for example) correctly implement payment options (Stripe docs).\n\nI read an article today that made me realize I might be shifting towards relying on ChatGPT rather than actively learning. As the professor in the article said: \"Working hard and struggling is actually an important way of learning. When you’re given an answer, you’re not struggling and you’re not learning.\" ([article](https://cacm.acm.org/news/the-impact-of-ai-on-computer-science-education/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)).\n\nHow do you guys look at this? What are your thoughts on this?",

It’s gonna turn programmers into generalists and it’s gonna turn bloated 100+ dev teams into 20+ teams while creating an expectation for quicker delivery.\n\n“Oh you boilerplate your pages?? How you gonna learn??“ well, my IDE does that with a shortcut. \n\nWith GPTs you struggle at different stages of the same problem. It’s like a higher-level language at this point. Any newcomer should adapt to it instead of pretenting to act like programming should be learned at a low level language like Assembly.\n\nIf programming is a hobby or you don’t have an incentive to make money, fine. Don’t use it. But if you want to meet the deadlines or push a product then you better get to employing it rather than trying to code every loop function by yourself.\n\nPeople forget how complex the landscape and proffesional demands on the employee at this point. And people need to get their heads out of their asses and stop being this “programmer-puritans”. Beginners need practical advice.\n\nYou want to build a complex SaaS? Do it. GPT will help you to build it from scratch and you’ll have more skills and production level experience than trying to raw-dog your calculator.\n\nThis is basic psychology. People are afraid that 20yos with GPT will ve after their paychecks and the reality is that they probably will. Know this and adapt to the new paradigm. Most industries landscape change yearly and tech is at the forefront. It’s good to have foundations but there is no need to be orthodox about learning practices. You’ll fail every step of the way. GPT does not save you from that.",

I’ve noticed that I enjoy building, creating, and designing more than diving deep into learning the fundamentals. I lean more towards applied science rather than being a computer science engineer. With ChatGPT, I can build more complex SaaS projects; otherwise, I would have stuck to simpler tools like my Netflix suggestion search tool or something similar.\n\nI got downvoted for even mentioning AI.

Perhaps some languages are better than others but I know pretty consistently ChatGPT is... sometimes wrong in ways that aren't obviously wrong.\n\nFor example - asking it to do something with SwiftUI and SwiftData - it'll sometimes fall back to a half Core-Data answer that won't work but **looks** like it *should* work at first glance - and searching for answers won't help you because everything will be many years old and very dated.\n\nThis is not a position that is ideal for beginners. It will simply add to confusion.\n\nNow if you're learning a *new* language, but are already (at least moderately) skilled at programming - certainly. But if my nephew who is literally just starting asked this - nah, avoid chatgpt like the plague. It *might* be useful. It might also do more harm than good.\n\nBut if someone said \"I learned it with the help of ChatGPT\" - I won't look down on them in any way. If they made it through, job well done.",

You can look at a piece of code and see, this isn't very readable and ask the gpt to focus on that. You can take a piece of code that the gpt produces and find the errors quickly. A beginner never has trained that level of understanding or problem solving, which is why I'm mixed about even asking a gpt for explanations. Even if a beginner coder asked a gpt to spit out something that follows SOLID principles, do they even know enough to be able to determine whether the code produced does in fact follow SOLID?\n\nBecause even \"problem solving\" and \"drawing insight\" itself are skills that needs to be practiced. Thinking for yourself, researching, understanding ideas, putting the pieces together logically, all take practice to get good at. Again, people at your level of experience use a gpt as just one of the pieces of the puzzle because you've already trained those skills, but a beginner wouldn't necessarily have.",

It can greatly hinder you if you aren't deliberate and cautious in how you use it, and since you either are or aren't advanced enough to discern between helpful and unhelpful approaches, it's easy to use it incorrectly.\n\nedit to add: I've watched startups die because officers who thought they learned enough code from ChatGPT thought they could 'brute force' a viable product using ChatGPT rather than hire and trust the engineers. I've had to explain that it would be faster, safer, and more efficient to let engineers finish one task and get to the next task, than it would be for an officer to learn programming concepts, git flows, and then TypeScript and SQL from ChatGPT and start working on back-end tickets. I've had to defend technical designs and implementations against a salesperson with ChatGPT.\n\nThis perfect storm of arrogance, ignorance, and confidence creates conditions that allow AI input to kill the company/product/project.

It often gets things reasonably right, but it also often gets things very wrong in very subtle ways, and without deeper expertise you likely won't notice if it does.\n\nMy advice is to use ChatGPT sparingly, mainly as a step before Google if you can't find the right words to search for something. For example, if you see some weird syntax you don't understand, ChatGPT is usually great at giving you the right terms that you can Google to find more official information. Likewise, if you have no idea how to solve a problem and can't find useful answers by searching, ChatGPT can often steer you in the right direction.\n\nThe most important thing is to not take its answers as final answers. Don't assume something is true just because ChatGPT says it; take the terms it gives you and use them to dig deeper with trustworthy sources (MDN is great for web dev stuff). Don't just ask it for code and copy-paste the response hoping it works; if you want to use any code it produces, you should pick it apart and make sure you understand every single keyword, operator, function, etc. that it uses.",

For example, since you are new to coding and trying to learn, maybe start your ChatGPT Conversations with   \n  \n\"I am brand new to web development and looking to learn. I understand <XYZ> already but need more detailed information about everything else. Please assist me in learning by explaining in a way that I, as a new web developer, could understand\"\n\nYou could then follow up with your questions and have a proper conversation to learn. Also, don't take everything ChatGPT says at face value. Its trained on items that already exist, written by other people, it may or may not be trained on actual documentation (more on this later). Therefore, anything it gives you, read it, try to understand, but then go and try to look up the syntax it is giving you and verify its correct/read documentation on the syntax. \n\nIf the syntax appears to be incorrect, since things get updated all the time, you are able to paste in the documentation and the AI will parse it and make its corrections.",

Here's a code that does The Thing! And a bit about how it works\"\n\n> Explain to me more about how this works and some other approaches I might take.\n\n\"Sure!  I went with this because X.  But you might want to use Y or Z depending on your situation.\"\n\n\nThen study what it tells you.\n\nThe only rule I'd say to avoid using it as a crutch (and I seriously applaud the impulse!) is to have that exchange with the thing.  But then try to write it from scratch.\n\n\"In The Before Time\"\n\nI learned to code largely through magazines that came with listings for games in BASIC.  I'd sit with the magazine on my lap and type.  Of course nothing would work at all until you were finished.  But the code could be several pages long.\n\nYou do all that work and it doesn't go.  Then you have to figure it out.  THAT'S the lesson.\n\nThese tools, as much as it sickens me to admit it, give you an opportunity to \"sit with the magazine in your lap\" but have exactly the code you need at any given time at your disposal.\n\nYou'll know if you're using it as a crutch too badly.\n\nBut use The New Hotness.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me I have to go drink a bottle of peptol bismol because I just made myself sick by that admission.\n\no7",

In the same way that if you were being tutored by a real person and you got them to do all the problem solving and researching answers for you you wouldn't be able to code independently, if you get an AI to do everything for you you also won't be able to code without it. A real human tutor can recognise you using them as a crutch though, whereas an AI will just continue doing everything you ask of it, and most beginners I see using AI do end up using it as a crutch even when they intend to use it just as a tutor. For that reason I always suggest avoiding AI until you are confident at the basics using just your brain, documentation, and stack overflow, then gradually mix in AI so it can help you learn. I never suggest using AI to generate code unless you've been programming long enough to understand what it spits out.",

Any piece of code I have copied from the AI more than 5 lines long I assume I will have to rewrite it. \n\nIt has done wonders for my confidence in coding with the language though, which I think is important because I am more likely to try and use it and thus improve my skills further.",

                "body": "I'm a newbie but hopefully some of my things I've learned along my journey/experience may help you or someone else reading this post.\n\nMy first programming project (started learning a few months ago) was using python to integrate ChatGPT via openAi API key into my linux command line in Terminal to help me learn bash commands. I have found that ai is bad at complex code but very good at explaining terms and definitions and reasons why things work. What has worked best for me when learning how to program, is deciding on a project I want to create with a goal that I can achieve (like learning API calls and simplistic python scripting to integrate chatGPT into my command line) and then learn how to program from my trial and errors and trial and succeeding over and over while I attempt to achieve that goal and create the project im working on. In simple terms, find something you want to create/do, then learn by slowly creating that project. You'll sharpen your tools as you go.  Reading documentation has been extremely helpful for me as well as telling chatGPT what documentation to read then asking it for simple explanations for specific questions about certain topics within the documentation.\n\nMost of all have fun with it, if you like tinkering, you'll enjoy programming because its a lot of messing up then figuring out your mistakes and improving/problem solving over and over till you get it just right, and then going back over and trying to clean up your code. Also I've found it extremely helpful to use comments to mark out what certain segments of your code do so you can look back on them and learn from them and so its more organized and therefor easier to go back to certain segments that you know your issue is in, and fix it.\n\nAnother thing that's really helped me along my journey is installing linux on an old machine I had laying around and learning linux by just daily driving it, messing up and fixing it, installing random things on it for random purposes (like a plex server and a black ops 3 zombies server), configuring those random things, learning what ssh is and how to use it to remotely control my linux machine (and learning how to configure my ssh connection so its secure and using an uncommon port which helped me learn more about networking and safety), and eventually installing some stuff and configuring some more stuff that I ended up screwing something up so bad that I just decided to wipe the machine clean and reinstall linux and do it all over again. That's been the most helpful in my learning journey that I've been experiencing so far!   \nCheers mate!",

I believe this is relevant because it seems like with the code I’m working on (intro level python, Java, and MIPS) I have yet to run into ChatGPT code that is not obvious when it’s wrong. Whenever I’ve used code that was wrong, the program didn’t work/I’d get errors that I would then need to troubleshoot(tbh I’ve actually learned more sometimes from conversations with ChatGPT that take many tries to get it right). Still, I agree that if all I did was copy and paste code and got A’s on all of my exams, assignments, or projects, then I’d basically just be wasting my time and money. I know most people here basically said, it’s not what you do, it’s how you do it…. But I still got the sense that one of the main concerns here is not knowing if the answer is correct. Therefore my question is: if I’m taking time to examine the ChatGPT code line by line, then how is that worse than googling IF it’s true that at this level the code either works or it doesn’t?",

Yes, you can improve your (already existing) skills by learning common patterns and common approaches, but you cannot learn *problem solving* that way.\n\nProgramming is problem solving, not throwing out code. If you cannot come up with solutions to your problems, you cannot write programs for them.\n\nWhen you look at code, you only see the *end product*, yet, you do not see the design choices, compromises, and decisions made along the way to arrive at the code. You miss the entire important part of the process.\n\nYou may understand the *solution*, but you will not learn to derive the solution from the problem, you will not learn to arrive at the code.",

If you want to build a foundation of knowledge it is usually not enough to read an explanation. For learning, the journey *is* the destination.\n\nI would recommend:\n\n * actively try to work out the solution yourself, put in effort\n * ask for a hint if you are stuck on the specific thing  (do not give the Ai your full task you are working on but a specific question you currently are stuck on \"how do I determine if a number is divisible by 3?\" instead of \"I want to program fizzbuzz in python can you help me and explain your solution?\") sometimes Googling this might be a better idea. \n * widen the scope of your request if it doesn't help, repeat until you have to ask for code and explanations\n * prepare a similar exercise where you would have to solve similar problems to reinforce you actually learned something\n\nYou are not trying to solve a task, you are trying to learn something.\n\nYou also risk to shorten the loop over and over. This is a really easy trap to fall into. It is so easy to ask as soon as you run into a problem instead of ever thinking about it yourself. And soon you will be copy pasting code as everyone told you not to, because you tell yourself you \"understand the code from reading\". In reality, when pressed to solve a problem yourself, you will fail though, because your understanding was shallow.\n\nThis is not unique to Ai, the shallow understanding is a problem of books and lectures as well.",

If I didn’t have the great foundation I’d spend forever trying to get something to work that would only take me minutes now to fix.

When you browse for answers in Stack Overflow you will frequently get several answers and the one which is deemed the best is given a green check mark.  That is cool, but you will also get other answers that work and this will teach you something about the alternatives available to you.  Also, When you spend time on researching your questions you retain more information rather than just asking somebody or something for a solution.\n\nWe are getting to the point in programming where much of the code is generated by some framework and AI tools can take a stab at a solution.  In the future, programmers will have a different role and we won't be writing so much code.  We'll be designing and troubleshooting.  If you want to learn to write code, fingers on the keyboard and failure are your best teachers.",

If you were just going to copy/paste information, then you were doing it wrong, but if you were going to follow the information on Wikipedia back to its original source, then it was a great tool. \n\nSame goes for AI. If you’re going to copy/paste code without knowing what the code does, why it works, if it’s actually correct… well, you’re doing it wrong. The same can be said for StackOverflow. AI is just a new tool. It needs to be used correctly. \n\nYou can use a wrench to drive a nail, and sure, it eventually gets the job done, but you’re still doing it wrong.",

You just have to be careful to make sure that you're prompting it to actually teach you, and not to just write all of your code for you without understanding what it did. That's the beauty of it though, if it produces code you don't understand, you can just ask it why the code works and you'll get a good explanation 99% of the time for beginner concepts.\n\nIs chatGPT sometimes wrong? Sure, but for beginner stuff it's actually pretty accurate. The nice thing about coding too is that it's low stakes- you can run what it gives you and verify the script actually does what it's claiming it will.\n\nIt's a great debugging tool too when you're starting out. Code not working as you would expect? Paste it into GPT and describe the issue- it might be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nCheers and best of luck learning programming!",

Debugging in an IDE was beyond the scope of the course. Back when I was taking a python intro course myself, we didn't go over debugging either beyond using print statements. There's a reason the courses are structured that way. My sections struggled enough with the assignments alone. I'm pretty confident many of them would have been overwhelmed trying to learn how to use a debugger at that point. That's not to say there aren't beginners who could or should jump right into using a debugger, but it's not one size fits all. If chatGPT can easily help somebody understand their script's execution flow better, then sometimes that's OK imo.",

        "selftext": "First of all, I am not comfortable with asking for help anymore online when it comes to coding, programming, and HTML. Reddit, Discord, and StackedOverflow have given me way too many negative experiences for over 4 years ever since my community college days. I am a late bloomer and an older student who got their Associate's in IT and am working for a Bachelor's in Information Science and while I have very basic coding experience in SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python, I still basically just a beginner. It is too mentally exhausting and disheartening hearing the amount of rudeness, negativity, and toxicity from people online when it comes to asking for help. \n\nBasically, throughout my 4 years of higher education in my later years, the results have always been the same from people on the internet whether I was asking for help in what I was learning in class and to reinforce my learning, or if it was for my own personal benefit of self-learning and self-studying:\n\n* \"Just Google it\" (Which I do constantly, and if I were able to find it, I would not be asking help online in the first place. Additionally, the time it takes to simply help someone is similar to the time it takes to Google something and it does not cost anything to help someone or be kind and understanding)\n* \"We aren't going to spoonfeed you\" (I really hate the word \"spoonfeed\". It's kind of the same mentality as people in Soulsborne communities or high-skill games telling you to \"git gud\", something that also turns me off and grinds my gears. The attitude about spoonfeeding is something I will never understand from other rude and toxic people online, nor do I agree from their perspective)\n* They simply do not want to help but want to be rude/toxic/negative and comment anyways (I never understand what drives people to actually do this. This is moreso on Reddit than anything else)\n*  We aren't going to do your \"homework\" for you (Again, whenever I have asked for help regarding anything, I always ask what am I doing wrong after showing my code or ask \"how would I tackle this problem\" if I don't understand how to even go about writing the pseudocode structure to plan the coding. This has happened both in my community college years, as well as when I was self-learning and people simply did not want to help. If people cannot or will not help with learning, it is a loss on the individual's part and they may never learn if they don't know what to learn or people refuse to guide them. It is like trying to learn a foreign language, but nobody will help teach you the grammar, vocabulary, or speaking rules you need to learn to start practicing reading/writing/speaking)\n\nThese are just various examples I remember from the last 4 years. I have had different experiences with people IRL where professors when people are kind enough to help if they understand, as well as some acquaintances tell me in the real world, if someone is stuck, it brings the whole team down, so the seniors do their best to help their juniors understand everything as long as it takes and answer all their questions to keep the workflow going. But online, it's the complete opposite. There have been many times where I could not find the information I needed on Google (or I had no idea what to actually Google and research) and people flat out refused to help, so not only did I not learn anything, I eventually just gave up and could not learn what I needed to. This has put me off from programming, coding, HTML, etc. and even though I want to learn coding for my own personal goals, it demotivates me to learn due to my experiences of rudeness and toxicity from communities online (Don't even get me started on when I was trying to learn Linux and dealing with the  Linux community).\n\nNow, since ChatGPT-4.0 is the latest version, and after seeing Reddit posts that argue for and against it for helping to learn, I decided to try it out and see for myself. I was having some difficulty and errors in working some of my code (regarding HTML5.0, JavaScript and my CSS), as well as following guides, since I was applying the stuff in the video to code I was writing myself, but the code was not working. I asked ChatGPT about my code, told it my problem and asked me what am I doing wrong, to explain it in detail, why it was wrong, and how to fix it. By continously asking it the right questions, not only was I able to debug and fix my errors in coding, or make the non-responsive functions responsive, but learn what  I was doing wrong and the mistakes I made (It turned out I was either writing the wrong thing, or I was introduced to a new way of fixing my problem with adding one simple line of code suggested from ChatGPT). It is almost like I am asking an artificial programmer on what I am doing wrong, to explain it to me in a simpler manner, and how to fix the errors or non-responsiveness. I honestly felt a lot more comfortable asking ChatGPT as it actually helps me learn and understand in a way that works for me, but also cuts out the rudeness, negativity, and toxicity I have experineced. It's also why I prefer Youtube videos and guides over asking people.\n\nSo is it okay to use ChatGPT to help learn and debug my code as well as explain my mistakes if I cannot find what I am looking for on Google or Youtube, and if I'm not comfortable asking for help from people online?",

                "body": "Okay, there's a lot to unpack here but I'm going to answer the original question in a vacuum:\n\n>is it okay to use ChatGPT as a way to help understand mistakes and to help explain and fix errors/debugging if I don't understand something?\n\nYes, this is a perfectly valid use case for chatgpt. However it's important to understand how it's best used. I never ask chatGPT for code, and I've learned that just asking \"what's wrong with this code?\" almost never works. ChatGPT is best when you're asking it to explain what's going on. Ask it to summarize a class, a script, explain some regex, untwist some nested ternaries, etc. The more specific the better.\n\nIt is also exceptionally good for rubber ducking. If you're not familiar, it's when you talk about a problem out loud and in doing so, come to a solution you didn't think of before since you had to explain every part of the problem to someone else (in olden days, talking to a rubber duck on your desk). ChatGPT is fantastic for this. Often I'll start typing out a question to chatgpt only to realize I figured out the answer as I begin to structure my question and provide context.\n\nAlso use it to learn what you don't know. Asking if there are alternative ways to solve problems is great because usually you will learn a word or phrase that you can then google to read further documentation about. If you do use it to write a bit of code, ask it to explain what each lines does. If it does something you don't understand, and this is the important part, take the time to understand it. Go outside of ChatGPT and read documentation, ask it to explain further, etc. It sounds like this is how you are using it already.\n\nHere are some things I've used it for:\n\n* Asking specific coding questions if I can't remember syntax (\"How does JavaScrips array mapping work again?\")\n* I'll outline how I'm thinking of structuring a certain part of a program and have it summarize my architecture to see if it make sense.\n* Ask it to explain what some regex or a bash script is doing.\n* See if there are alternative ways of solving problems, \"Is there another way to conditionally check for this variable other than writing a bunch of if/else statements?\" etc\n\nBasically, the broader and more ill defined the question, the less helpful your answer will be.\n\nNow onto the second half of your post, which I think might be the bigger problem:\n\n>It is too mentally exhausting and disheartening hearing the amount of rudeness, negativity, and toxicity from people online when it comes to asking for help.\n\nHow are you asking these questions? It is very easy to fire off a question that you may think is simple to answer, but if you aren't showing that you're working to understand it, you're going to be met with rudeness. When you ask a question, it should be specific, you should provide enough broader context for people to understand the bigger picture, and you should explain what you have already tried and what you are thinking of trying next that you're not sure of.\n\nThe latter points are important - that's what tells people that you're making an effort and are really stuck. Just asking \"How can I do x?\" doesn't tell people that you've put in the work to read documentation, try multiple solutions, and are trying to help yourself.  You should ask something like \"I'm looking for help with doing X. For context, this is part of an application that does Y and Z. So far I've tried A and B, but that didn't work/got me errors, etc. I was trying to do C but I found it to not be well documented and confusing. Would someone be able to point me in the right direction?\"\n\n>Additionally, the time it takes to simply help someone is similar to the time it takes to Google something and it does not cost anything to help someone or be kind and understanding)\n\nMaybe you're asking questions the right way and just running into jerks, but this statement makes me think otherwise. People's time is their own and they do not owe you anything. Especially if you are asking for help in a public forum, people don't want to help someone that hasn't indicated they're willing to help themselves.\n\nAnd I get it. When I started out four years ago I had the same attitude. Googling is a hard skill and asking someone who I know has the answers is so much easier. But that's not how you learn. You can teach yourself to fish and you're going to be such a better programmer because of it. ChatGPT is a great way to practice fishing for yourself. Practice asking it questions and take the extra second to do some research that might net you the answer before pinging someone else.\n\nYou'll get better at this and don't be afraid to use the tools at your disposal to get where you need to be!",

Most of the time, they're very useful tools.  Every now and then, they are confidently, and terribly incorrect.\n\nAt my last job, they cleared us to use copilot, and for one of the projects I had to turn the damn thing off -- it kept making recommendations that were security nightmares, algorithmically wrong, or both.\n\nChatGPT is the more dangerous one, though.  With Copilot, you're right there in the IDE looking over the recommendations its making.  ChatGPT gives you a conversational interface and will offer up explanations and describe what the code does.  But it doesn't *really* understand.  ChatGPT is like super fancy multivariate linear regression wrapped up in human language.  Most of the time its presenting something sane and helpful, but there's no indication that its wrong for the occasions that it has started an elaborate hallucination.  As the human in these interactions, you need to have reliable domain knowledge that you can lean on as you're looking over its recommendations.\n\nI suspect you'll encounter few hallucinations as you work through programming basics, most of the material it has trained on for that stuff is pretty good.  Just keep an eye out for weird behaviors in your code once you get into the weeds.",

It says no AI GENERATED message or comments. The second paragraph suggests as such, since it explicitly mentions \"ai generated content\". Rule 13 is about asking questions about *code generated by* chatgpt, not asking questions about chatgpt itself.

It took me a good 20-25 minutes of typing this out and editing. There is no rule stating you cannot discuss it. Also, there is nowhere in my post where I post ChatGPT generated code.

Even Amazon's model (i forget the name right now) should suffice.\n\nThough don't take my word for it. You should experiment for your given use case. It's hard to gauge what an LLM is good at without playing around with it since there are so many variables that go into what kind of responses they generate. I did a GenAI project recently and part of the work was doing discovery on the different models out there and comparing quality of responses, ease of use, etc.\n\nThe one advice I would say is always use the latest and greatest (if you have the money for it). When testing gpt3.5 vs 4.0, there was a big difference in quality of responses. I'd imagine Claude 3 vs 3.5 is the same.",

        "selftext": "Click baity title.  \n\nI'm a Software Engineer that's currently mentoring an intern and my intern's reliance on ChatGPT is not a good sign. This intern is tasked with writing some test automation in a framework we're both unfamiliar with, so there is bit of learning we have to do.  \n  \nThe problem is that, the other week, my intern was having issues writing a for loop in the new framework. His first and only idea was to ask ChatGPT how to write a for loop in said framework. And well, ChatGPT's solution was wrong so then the intern went to ask me what the problem was. Well first google result gave me the syntax for the for loop, which fixed the problem.  \n  \n  \nMy issue is that people who are learning or trying to get junior/entry level software engineering positions are relying on a service that gives wrong answers and take it as fact. There was no attempt to google the answer by my intern, and if they had the issue would have been solved in 30 seconds.\nAnd this intern will be starting their 4th year of CS at big university in the US.  \n  \nIf my manager was to ask my opinion on hiring this intern as full time employee, I would not recommend hiring just because of their reliance on ChatGPT and poor debugging skills (which include googling). Had my intern attempted to google first, my opinion would be a bit more positive.  \n\nOn a side note, in my industry (fintech), if you copy paste code into ChatGPT to debug, you will be fired. It may be more relaxed for other fields, but other should be aware that exposing proprietary code to outside parties/applications is a huge security risk.\n  \n\n  \n**EDIT**  \nI'd like to clarify that this is not an anti-AI post. But rather a warning to those that rely heavily on AI to learn how to program. Don't rely solely on AI if you're having issues, use other resources such as google/stackoverflow/official documentation, etc. And yes, my team provided the framework documentation and I did tell my intern to try searching google/documentation next time.",

So then you can ask \"where's the docs for that.\"\n\nThe thing that get tricky with LLMs is that while a real person will also give you a wrong answer occasionally, LLMs are experts at giving answers that seem correct. They will pretty much always give an authoritative sounding answer (unless you run into the content controls). With an LLM you can't rely on \"they sound pretty confident\", \"that sounds like a reasonable answer\", or \"they're pretty smart, so they probably know what they're talking about\", which are all things we're used to doing when getting answers from people.\n\nSo using an LLM is fine, as long as you have a way to independently verify the answer it gives you. Always assume there's a significant chance that the answer it gave you only *looks* correct.\n\nEdit: typos",

                        "body": "I will play a little devils advocate and say I sympathize with OPs intern a little. For whatever reason, Google's search algorithm has recently been utter shit for me. I've had to switch to bing god forbid. It rarely shows what I'm looking for unless I specifically am looking for stack overflow or reddit posts. Outside of those, it pretty much never gives me specific results.\n\nAlso, I think chatgpt is really good for giving it a line of code and asking what that line specifically does in great detail.\n\nBut if the intern is asking how to do a for loop, I think they need to learn the basics of coding in a more traditional sense like a book or a course. It's like the first thing you learn after setting variables, and I imagine they have some CS degree program they are currently in and should have taken at least a single programming course before taking the internship.",

ChatGPT can do this for most languages, but I think some less common languages it just isn't trained well on. The only time ChatGPT is going to totally mess up the syntax of a for loop is if it's in a language/framework/library it's not well-trained on, which sounds like the case here.\n\n\nI think OP forgets that ChatGPT is brand new and everyone is still figuring out what it's good for or not good for in their own career.",

Because those problems and their answers and explanations have been posted online hundreds of thousands of times. Which is why it starts to fall apart very quickly as the project size and complexity increase - that's when you really start to notice that it's just guessing (because it's always guessing).\n\nSo it's fine if you need a quick introductory preview of a topic. I use it like I use google. I just take everything it gives me with a huge chunk of salt, same as everything on the internet.\n\nWhat I can't fathom is how people try to debug their code with it. Such an insanely terrible habit.",

Actually, what it usually gets correct are programming related questions in my experience. That makes sense too, since the LLMs are probably trained with a bunch of manuals and textbooks about those topics. Other topics tend to be full of inaccuracies.\n\nOn the topic of the OP, I do think it's a great tool to be used for learning programming, it just gets misused a lot. Once you already have a built application it makes sense the AI wouldn't be too useful since it likely won't be familiar with your app specifically.",

It just makes things faster and easier.\n\nIf you are expecting the llm to write your entire code base for you, while simultaneously reading your mind, that might be your disconnect there.\n\nIt’s not able to do that, and no reasonable person thinks it can. What it does do, however, is get some of the mundane stuff out of the way, can generate a solid function if you provide very specific instructions, help debug error codes, give you advice on migrating your gitlab project, help you learn python, etc.\n\nIt’s not perfect at any of those, as op calls out, but it is definitely good enough to be very useful and be a speed booster if your expectations are realistic and you figure out how to use it for what it’s good at.\n\nAfter all, it is just a tool.",

Coming back to it when I'm done on the other stuff.\n\nAs for prototyping... do I need a pagination component? Great, gimme some code ChatGPT. I'm gonna replace probably 90+% of it anyways, but I need to see how it looks with 10 items on the page versus 20 items and don't care if it looks pretty right now. I might not even want pagination, maybe I actually want all items. It's a prototype.\n\nFinally dummy data is truly where I use it the most. Gimme 20 items following X schema. Glorious. Absolute treasure. **Gimme an about us page for X company so that I don't need lorem ipsum for the thousandth time.** It's a game-changer. This is truly what LLMs exist for. Making up the crap public relations would normally argue over for 6 weeks (/s), but I get to style it up off rip looking something similar to what they're going to write anyways.",

It's great for Regex, xpath, taking code from language A to language B, generating unit tests. there's a host of things it's pretty great for. A lot of stuff I would give to a junior i can just feed to gpt and good a good-enough result. \n\nI think for me personally. I don't know if i've ever copy/pasted something directly from gpt without going over it and changing it. It's awful at naming variables imo for example, or coupling logic into single functions. It has a tendency i guess in my opinion to do too much. But like, the jist of it is there.\n\n  \nHonestly, I actually hate the rhetoric around LLMs, oh LLMs are just stats, or LLMs are just guessing what you want. It's verifiably false and damagingly reductive. I don't think juniors should be avoiding gpt either. Would you tell a junior dev to code everything in notepad because the IDE does too much. Or maybe dont use this extension because it's too helpful? Never. It's \"Use this extension because it helps you here\", \"This keyboard shortcut will make you faster when doing this\", and \"This IDE is great for this language\". GPT has to be a part of the conversation otherwise i think THEN you get into the place where juniors over-rely on it. People need to understand it's a powerful tool and how to use it. I think it's up to the senior guys on the team to convey that message.",

It's great at pointing you in the right direction and keeping you moving forward. But it shouldn't be the only tool you use.\n\nYou've just got to remember at the end of the day you're the smarter one. And it's just an LLM. You're far more capable of telling fact from fiction.\n\nI think you're being a little harsh on the intern though. They're learning and making mistakes. That's their job as an intern. Most interns suck at debugging. It's a learned skill that can take years of experience to master. It's your job as his senior to get him up to speed on what tools are reliable.",

Locked door, try a latch slip. Nothing, bust out the lockpick gun. If that doesn't work, start raking. If that fails, probe the individual pins. Still nothing, bounce your tool with bitch picking.\n\n\nYour Intern tried the first thing that came to their mind, saw it fail, and went to the next tool they knew of, to reach out to a coworker for help. They avoided the worst-case of getting stuck and spinning his wheels. I think they may still develop to be a good coder if you can encourage them to develop their research skills- there was a time when Google Fu wasn't a universal skill, that time seems to have returned, and teaching them to not rely on just their first hammer will help fill that critical problem solving toolkit for the future and become a valuable worker.",

Bot responses come with no feedback and they often don't offer alternatives.\n\nI can appreciate that some people just like the conversation model more, and it might be easier to use with followup questions because it can remember context for you which can simplify your queries.\n\nI work with LLM's from several different services that help with coding-related tasks and some are better than others, but they get so much wrong that I would never use them personally (I can understand why some people might, though). Top Google results and SO answers are often wrong, too, so I don't think this is so much of a new problem as some people seem to, but I do feel like those services fare much better when the top answers are wrong, whereas LLM's are likely to waste more of your time if they don't initially get it right.",

And looked down on ppl who used too many 'premade' sounds as 'less than'. Fast forward 10 years, and those ppl i thought of as 'lesser artists' were running laps around me and made some of my favorite songs.\n\nNow older and wiser, anytime I want to do something, I say fk all the 'shoulds'. Get ur shit done and completed with every tool available. Bring ur ideas to life however you choose.\n\nB/c at the end of the day no one cares how 'clean' an app was made, or how long someone spent sketching and underpainting on a canvas, or how many hours you spent crafting a synth. They only care about the result and I only cared about doing something the 'right' way or the 'real' way bc I placed too much of my self worth into those labels and was able to rest on my laurels and turn my nose up at everyone taking 'shortcuts'.\n\nFor me, topics that relate in this way, were all about swallowing my pride; and realizing all the ideas of 'proper art' were just stories I told myself.\n\nSo now, if I want to paint a large mural outside for everyone to see, who tf cares if i used ai to gen the image, and a projector to project the stencil. Literally no one cares, especially if it looks nice and I get to the fun part of painting faster.\n\nEspecially, as these thoughts pertain to this ***rapidly*** changing world. Thoughts of the 'proper methods' in *most* scenarios is only hampering actualization of *your* goals and ideas.",

And I read about one guy who talked about his ADHD attributed to him not being too afraid of just start problem solving, testing and changing things. Basically the ability to jump straight in, a lot quicker than most “normal people”. \n\nFor me personally I always keep thinking and philosophizing during breaks and when I’m off work if I’m working on something tough that I haven’t solved yet. Hyperfocus going into overdrive etc. And hopefully I don’t trigger burnout from this. But I love what I do and love digging deeper into weird stuff. \n\n\nI’m a junior dev, and I used to prompt ChatGPT for most “silly” concept-like questions. Light questions were I had a thought and wanted to know best practice stuff. Pros and cons using foreach vs for loops, can this code turn into a one-liner LINQ expression? \n\nAnd other times I just used it in case some unknown built in method was mentioned. Then I could go to the dev docs and read about it. \n\nIt didn’t take long until ChatGPT was out of the question, and not only because of confidentiality but also due to OOP and the multitude of classes I would need to copy paste for a minuscule chance of getting a decent reply. \n\nSo less and less prompting now. \n\nAnd I have to mentioned I started working at the same time as another junior who used ChatGPT all the time… and I can already see that the early prompting for answers on his part has hampered his problem solving skills. Most of the tickets we work on are too complex to query and he has kinda started to just sit and wait for the answer to magically appear or something.",

It can fully heal with proper treatment, but it takes time and professional treatment + when you get back you're gonna doubt your skills for some time.\n\nI thought my sabbatical to treat burnout would take a month - it took three (+ therapy, + meds) before I got to the point where I would be productive and could start looking for a job again. \n\n(This is obv anecdotal and there will be high variance here).\n\nIf I may offer some advice, things that would have helped me avoid burnout:\n\n* Be very rigorous about taking your time off (and ideally just go for vacation). It's a necessity like exercise, getting enough sleep, eating nutritious food - maintenance for your body.\n\n* It's ok to do some overtime either if there's a real need for it (emergency, real deadline e.g. to comply with new laws) or if you're doing it \"for yourself\" (need more money; making up time to finish early on another day; you're just having fun). But: always get paid, and never do it for long stretches of time. Already two weeks will take their toll.\n\n* If you get into the habit of delivering ambitious features/products ahead of the time and everyone - including yourself - is super impressed with how hard you work? This is a warning sign, ponder if you're overdoing it. Imagine what you would think if a friend was working as hard - if you'd be concerned about them, you should be concerned about yourself.\n\nSorry for rambling, I know you already know this, but sometimes hearing it from someone else helps.",

It honestly reflects poorly on you as a mentor if you're not directly telling them to stop using ChatGPT. Think if you were the manager discussing hiring them and your subordinate said, \"Well, they overly rely on ChatGPT.\" If you as manager asked yourself, \"Did you show them how to look up docs and encourage them to do that instead?\" What would your response be?\n\nIf it isn't, \"Yes, I showed them the docs and they still used ChatGPT.\" Well... that's a skill issue on your part.\n\nThis intern has spent the last 3 years in learning mode. Learning is probably the last thing they want to be doing (even though it's the right thing to do). It's understandable that they're trying to find a way out of the situation.\n\nIt's your job as a mentor to help them understand they have no other choice.

It may be more relaxed for other fields, but other should be aware that exposing proprietary code to outside parties/applications is a huge security risk.\n\nSure, but it's not like there aren't solutions to this. You could locally host Llama 3 and get results close to the same quality as ChatGPT without ever exposing your code to external sources.\n\nI'm not saying you *should* do this, but LLM's aren't going away and this sort of thing is going to be as common as Google within the next few years.\n\nAlso, even in fintech, most of your code isn't directly relevant to security. If someone can crack your system because you exposed some database CRUD code to OpenAI, you have more serious security problems than posting code to ChatGPT. There is secure open-source software, and the idea that general code exposure would create security vulnerabilities is a huge red flag indicating that the codebase already isn't secure.\n\nSource obfuscation is one of the least reliable methods of security. If reading your source code allows people to access your systems, you already have a security failure. There are exceptions, of course, like token generation algorithms or any built-in tokens, but no company in the financial sector should rely on hidden source code for data security.\n\nI work for a market research company. I'd probably be fired if someone reading any of my source code could expose customer data or gain unauthorized access to our systems.\n\nI had to do some research because I couldn't believe this sort of thing was standard in fintech. But it appears to be as exposed source could expose security vulnerabilities. That's absolutely terrifying to me, but at the same time, it's probably cheaper to hide vulnerable code than actually spend the time to write secure code in the first place.",

During a session he even had the balls to pull up chatgpt, prompt it with some code and tried to decipher it / copy paste stuff. I asked him if he even understood half of it. It's a major turn off getting asked to help someone, finding time and trying to guide them (not feeding them the answers mind you) and then this happening because he can't put 2 and 2 together. I wouldve been so happy if instead of a prompt that gave him some Code - he'd googled and ended up on docs or a tutorial and said hey I'm going to study this for a while. \n\nJuniors (and interns alike) please stop using chatgpt. Use this time to educate yourself, your productivity isn't the most important thing.\n\nLearn how to debug, the tools are awesome these days. Click through methods, set break points, examine the state of the application trhoghh its callstack. Read the javadoc for fucks sake.\n\nIf you don't understand some documentation or if it's too verbose or whatever: paste that into chatgpt and ask it questions. It's a language model, it predicts the next token. That's what it's good at.\n\nI'm genuinely about to ban this entire goddamn tool. Part of becoming a software engineer is making mistakes, being stuck, scrounging docs, learning how to formulate a proper question so next time you encounter something similar you will recognize it: not mindlessly paste snippets into some tool.",

Text transformers like ChatGPT bear an inherent risk, due to them being able to hallucinate. With enough knowledge on the subject you can fairly quickly discern if what it says is plausible. However, you might understand what it does but never why. And once you leave the realm of well understood problems, youre suddenly stranded.\n\nI found that students, apprentices and other (mostly) inexperienced devs approach transformers very naively. This means that they treat the result from the AI like puzzle pieces and slot them in. If it still doesnt work, they generate another piece and keep going so long until there is a solution. They know what the individual piece does and maybe what the whole should do. But they have never made enough effort so to to learn what their code does.   \n*^(This has already been a problem with spoonfeeding on stackoverflow, except now its exaggerated with lies.)*\n\nMy university has accepted that AI will now always be part of a students tools and they are acting accordingly. However, they also want to advise students how to best use AI. Unfortunately, my professor has not yet come to a definitive conclusion, so theres not much I can say or point towards. All thats apparent is that it makes you lazy.\n\nWith that said, I did come to the conclusion that there are methods to make AI an actually helpful companion. The Socratic Method is one of those, to turn ChatGPT into your rubber duck. Writing E-Mails is another. Having AI write code for you to use, is not one of them.",

No problem, it's not priority. He isn't asking me any questions and I'm not checking in closely as I've stuff to do.\n\nHe comes to me on the second day, no progress made. Turns out the very first thing he'd done was ask ChatGPT to build him a React component with a toggle, then add persistence etc. The nonsense it spat out looked fine but, of course, didn't work at all. He then spent the rest of the day \"fixing\" that code (not sure how exactly). In his mind he wasn't stuck, he was fixing it, so he wasn't asking for help. Code that didn't need to be fixed, because it was fundamentally not suitable even if it had done what he described. Basically the blind leading the blind.\n\nBecause of this, and issues with another junior pasting code with secrets into it, now heavily discourage my junior devs from using AI tools to generate code.\n\nIt's shit at writing code. It's shit at debugging code. At present, it's a glorified billion dollar Buzzfeed article and blog post generator. I really can't wait for the hype to die down because I feel like the quality of everything online is suffering at the moment.",

I think GPT is good for learning.\n\nI don't know why the hell people ask ChatGPT \"how do I do x\".\n\nDon't do it. First tell it to go online and check the online documentation for what you're working with. This way it will pull actual, proper data that it will then base its answers on.\n\nAt that point it's not ChatGPT telling you how something works, it's the documentation doing it instead. ChatGPT only parses that documentation and gives you answers to whatever questions you have about it.\n\nYou know... using a text model for text processing, like it should be used.\n\nSecond of all, I've heard so many times \"ChatGPT can't do math\". Yes, it can't do math for shit. But you need to be a complete ape to not figure out that all you have to say is \"use Python to do all the math for this problem\" and then \"now write a test that challenges the validity of this code\".\n\nCan it still be wrong? Sure, but you reduce the chance by orders of magnitude, compared to just directly telling it to do math.\n\nI've successfully learned the basics for electronics engineering and created a tazer fully off of ChatGPTs knowledge. Besides, whenever it hallucinates you can kinda tell. Sure you might miss it, but the hallucination usually looks out of place or over-confident.\n\nAnd a side-note: So many people try to use ChatGPT 3.5 or 4o. The first one is worse than a toddler and the latter is overconfidence gallore when you communicate with it in text. It was designed for real-time voice communication but they haven't released that part yet, so this 4o model is in this limbo of being faster than 4 but having real issues with hallucinations and repetitiveness.",

I’m finding using ChatGPT and copy/pasting the lot is similar to copy/pasting chunks of other people’s code that doesn’t do exactly what I want (“copy/pasting code is bad for learning”). I found the best is being able to understand the documentation and using it. The problem is the latter is also the slowest option, and the less you know, the harder it is to use it. And if you don’t know how to do it in the first place, you have to read a lot to find what you need. Or even better – understanding the fundamentals first, then using the documentation.  The trade off – it’s slow, but you also learn for the future, as understanding what you’re doing is the fastest option. If you can predict the future, you learn things you’ll use regularly.  Asking someone for help is also great because they can tell you things you didn’t even think you needed to know – especially if it’s on the job and they are doing similar. The catch is, it uses up other people’s time. \n\n\nIn reality, all approaches have their place and you shouldn’t rely on one. Sometimes I find myself wasting half a day on ChatGPT code, and then I google it, up comes the vignette of a useful package with an example of almost what I want to do combined with enough info to make the changes I want. Other times I wasted time trying to understand documentation, and ChatGPT uses something I haven’t considered, and gives it to me faster. And of course, there is how you use ChatGPT.",

                "body": "I've recently started learning react having most of my experience in data science. I'm more than capable of learning the fundamentals and quickly developing, but wanted to try learning via chat gpt as I have yet to use the shiny new toy for serious development.\n\nWith gpt-4o, it is correct the first or second time for 99% of inputs. Despite the extensive explanations it would give, I found myself becoming progressively more reliant on the LLM as the project grew. The biggest issue I faced is since I didn't write the code, when I need to change something I have to study how every file links to know where I should make the change. Had I written the code myself, I would intuitively know how the project works, and where I should make the change.\n\nIt's ironic because you would think chat gpt would enable rapid development, but you end up having to argue with a chat bot to get it to do what you want instead of just writing the code outright. It's definitely faster (and safer, and more efficient, and future proof) to learn legitimately.",

Everything you said in your post was correct. It sounds more like a lazy intern than an AI issue.\n\nI'm literally using it to build a fully functioning app in a language and framework I've never used. I'll admit, it doesn't always give the right answers, but if you ask the questions in the correct manner, it's pretty good for basic to mid level concepts. It's up to the individual to do some extra research, then you can make the decision whether to implement or not.",

                "body": "I've been (vaguely) concerned that this might be happening. This sinister thing about CGPT is that it basically never admits it doesn't know (I have never gotten it to say that actually), and all it's answers sound convincingly reasonable. If I ask it about technical stuff in a field I don't know very well, like say paleontology, it sounds 100% smartypants to me. It's only when I ask it about CompSci that I can see the parts that are right, the parts that are wrong, and the parts that are \"right\" but not really best practice.\n\nI use CGPT like a enhanced search engine, and I think that's how it should be used in programming ideally. Sometimes if Google is not turning up exactly what you want, CGPT can get you started on things to Google. For example today I asked it to write a program that plays sound in ALSA in C. I've never worked directly with ALSA before, so this was helpful to get started. Then I looked up the functions it used in the ALSA docs (which are kind of terrible autogened doxygen garbage btw), and fairly significantly refactored it's code into a proper C++ class with threading and a sound queue and everything.\n\nThe original program CGPT spit out actually worked the first time, but was doing some shoddy stuff with confusing variable names, an unnecessary memcpy() for every sample frame, etc.\n\nSome of the junior people I've worked with are already outputting questionable code, maybe this can make it better, but I wonder if just being given the answer helps them learn as much, and it's probably better to be learning from good examples rather than mediocre examples in the first place. I know that when something is already working, it's tempting to just wrap it up and not check into what exactly e.g. snd\\_pcm\\_hw\\_params\\_calloc() is doing and why it's there.\n\nThe other thing I've found CGPT semi-useful for, is to bounce implementation ideas off of when you're stuck. However for the most part, I've found it pretty terrible at data structure design (anything you'd put in a .h file basically), so it's really more like it might say something that gives ME an idea than that it's likely to come up with the perfect solution on it's own. I've accomplished the same thing by just talking to non-programmer friends, really. If you are just learning, doing this may help introduce you to concepts such as hashtables or spanning trees, but don't expect it to come up with an optimum design on these higher-level view kind of tasks -- even though it may not be obvious it's not a great design if you don't have a lot of experience.",

Clearly.  But at this point in history, they should also probably be able to ChatGPT a bit. I've been doing some retro-programming (for NES), which is mostly new to me - and ChatGPT has been the fastest path sometimes.  Or, obviously, sometimes I google, or even (shudder!) read proper documentation.\n\nAnyway, I find this overall take hilarious.  It's not long ago that people would have written the same post about programmers who rely on Google (or StackOverflow, or Usenet) for everything.  An intern who didn't try Googling first is a bit bizarre, but it's not like bad interns are a phenomenon that just came along with AI.",

It can also help with repetitive and boring tasks in familiar languages. I've learned python before the whole AI thing took off, so I would say I have decent beginner googleing skills and would manage perfectly fine without LLMs but it's just very convenient to ask questions in plaintext and also receive what looks to be the right answer. I love to use it for GUI generation. Because it's so much code that's repetitive that I frankly don't like it too much. But other stuff is simpler to do by hand, especially if it depends on a bunch of code that the LLM doesn't understand. Sometimes, the things it generates are plainly not usable, so it's definitely necessary to know what you do before asking an LLM to do it for you.",

If your just trying to plagerize then honestly chatGPT is probably gonna give you better more relevant code than a google search.\n\nLet's be real, every dev relies on google atleast occasionally. this is no different. You just need to be able to filter out the bad results and learn the best way to phrase queries to get what your looking for. For instance for looking up basic syntax for a loop, your best just googling an example or looking at the docs. But if your trying to find out how to sort a list of objects by one of their variables chatgpt is often going to give you a personalized answer that fits your specific use case better than google or the docs. If it doesn't then your gonna have to ask a detailed question on reddit or stack voerflow or whatever.",

I don't think the world is ending because an intern asked you a question he probably could've googled. This is probably the first time ChatGPT has failed them, and they probably already learned their lesson without you needing to drag them through the mud on reddit. \n\nThe paid version of ChatGPT usually does quite well when the problem is basic and the language is common. I can see where the intern might've had success asking ChatGPT how to make a for loop in Java vs Python vs C++ and getting totally correct answers. So I can see why the interns first instinct wasn't \"GPT doesn't know for loop syntax.\" I literally never ran into that issue until I started using frameworks/libraries GPT didn't have as much training on, so I 100% understand where the intern is coming from. \n\n\nThe other thing is that sometimes people just know they'll get a better answer, more nuanced and more tailored answer from asking a person. I understand you're probably an introvert and don't like answering questions, but some people really do like asking a person about some things. It's always bothered me when there's a culture of shaming people for asking questions. I think that type of company culture a recipe for disaster because newer employees are prone to mess things up by not asking questions.",

An LLM model does not know it is correct. \n\nI mean there are many other factors and AI can be a great tool, but if it’s used as a learning tool, it’s like choosing someone to teach you who is self taught but also makes things up because they don’t really understand the material and will agree with you if you argue enough.

So it indireclty access the internet, in microsoft documentation for copilot i didn't find about it using internet. On openAI forum I got to know 2 functions to get latest data. some kind of internet API, and second a web scraper.\n\nSo I want to know what could be the possible endpoints. So I asked same question to copilot and it is stubborn at denying that he can use internet.\n\nEdit: \nAnother Question arised that some prompts are given a pass like they will give answer with info of 2024, but some gets blocked with answer of restriction of 2021. So there must be some weights which is causing this, so correct prompt injecting can lead us to endpoints/ web scrapper?",

Don’t get fooled by their marketing tactics! Lol What do you think the so called prompt “engineers” are doing? They only try to find some input group of words that make you think it can give you interesting answers, somehow. To game the gaming game of words matching. Zero intelligence implicated, no reasoning, no facts checking, no true knowledge, no meaning, nothing.",

Jupyter notebooks simply make it more convenient and save you steps, when you're doing certain kinds of tasks.\n\nThe best way to think of it is that Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for using code to process data, solve problems, or get answers.\n\nHowever, Jupyter notebooks are not designed at all for building apps.

The display won't be as convenient as notebooks (this is again, the point) but you can generate and view the same graphs, with the same code.\n\n> Could you elaborate a bit more on this? specifically the, \"any program that needs to be delivered to end-users or run for a long time on a server\" part.

They let you change and rerun bits of the code and have your outputs interspersed with your code.\n\nWith a webserver, the workflow is different. The entire server is started and restarted as one, there's no use to splitting it into cells. Also, servers are hosted on environments with no graphical environment.\n\nYou wouldn't distribute notebooks to end users (unless your end users are developers and researchers themselves) for the same reason you don't tell them to install an IDE — notebooks are a development tool. Non-technical end users shouldn't have to deal with them.",

In fact, Jupyter notebooks are open-source, meaning anyone can see the code and modify it.\n\nScripts are code. It's all code.\n\nYou can do ANYTHING with code. It's just a question of how challenging it is.\n\n>Could you elaborate a bit more on this? specifically the, \"any program that needs to be delivered to end-users or run for a long time on a server\" part. Why would Notebooks not be ideal on this regard?\n\nA Jupyter Notebook is an environment designed for programmers. You type in code and see your results. It's similar to an IDE.\n\nEnd users don't want to see the code. They want an app they can click on and get things done.\n\nJupyter notebooks are like the laboratory where you explore ideas.\n\nWhen you finish an idea and you want to turn it into a product, you use a different set of tools that help you put that together into an app, or a website, etc. so that users just see the app and not the code behind the scenes.",

Nobody argues that you should build every library you need from scratch every time, that's dumb. \n\nIf you know zero code, that initial \"rest of the fucking owl\" part of the script can be soul-crushing amounts of work to get through. Having to do it repeatedly even once you've learned the basics still takes quite a long time. When you're learning the tools and the language and the process all at once, it's nice to let someone else (something else) build a bit of the basic framework for you, so you can focus on learning the bits you know you need more work on. \n\nI'm not learning to become a professional, I'm learning so that I can pick up a couple extra automation options. If I had to write the baseline of every script I needed, I'd spend more time tracking down dumb typos than I would getting anything accomplished. Things that I already know, but would need to google to confirm every time - maybe I can find them quickly, maybe I can't. Maybe I google them and pull bad code and have to troubleshoot it. Maybe the copypaste from SO had a typo. It slows down the whole process, and not *every* script needs to be a complete from-scratch learning experience.\n\nGPT lets me throw together the function outlines and the loop formats that I already *understand how to use*. That gives me a perfect framework to review, test, confirm it works, confirm I understand it, adjust it as needed, and then come back with \"now I need a function to do X in Y way\" and play with that answer so I can learn something new. \n\nIs it a crutch? Sure. But so's google. It's just a faster crutch.",

If you just want to enhance your other profession with AI tools, write a little CRUD script etc, it of course does not make sense spending months to learn something that you will most likely not use a lot. However if someone is learning to code, I assume they most likely want to do it for a living.\n\nFor anyone who wants to do this for a living, at some point you will run into problems that are not well covered by the data on the internet, or the way the LLM generate answers, you might not even know the right question to ask. This is when the \"soul-crushing amounts of work\" pay off, since you start to see problem patterns, have experience how to debug and deduce what kind of problem you are facing, because you already spent a lot of time doing it. I have had a lot of these problems, where no amount of interfacing with chatgpt will bring you any closer to solving the problem, like when there is a quirk with a library that you had no clue about and need to eventually find and fix in one way or another.\n\nAnd for someone who wants to be a dev, he needs to be able to solve problems that chatgpt cannot solve (simple problems will eventually be automated) and for that you need a lot of experience where you bash your head into the wall for hours, thinking of different strategies and solutions.",

Instead, you should ask about the algorithms and patterns involved, and then delve into each algorithm and pattern step-by-step.

From my experience, I can say that you should not use it as a primary resource for learning something core like programming. It sometimes does give wrong answers in a very authoritative way and sometimes even after suggesting the incorrectness in its answer, it keeps repeating the same mistake with an authoritative tone again. So, my advise is advise is learn from an authoritative resource (book or course). Once you gain some experience in coding, you can perhaps start using it as a coding assisntant. I think professionals should definitely start using it as a coding assistant as it can enable them to be super productive. Even I have just started exploring as a coding assistant.",

Why should anyone else give a damn if someone plays a (single player) offline game with cheat codes instead of developing the skill to beat the game by themselves? If it's for fun, use AI all you want. And anyone who is being honest will admit that, actually AI will be quite effective for the sorts of projects that someone coding just fun will want to tackle.

Use text as the default.\n\n- Take this chunk of code and refactor it to DRY it up\n\n- Debug this code, why is it throwing an error?\n\n- Take these loosely compiled notes and turn it into a markdown formatted document for others to understand\n\nI don't let it write code for me but I use it often to help me with these kinda tasks.",

You just ''know'' the language now. You can take a break for a week or two and when you sit back down, you'll still know the language. You can now express your own thoughts in it. It comes more naturally. (Sure, you still have to google something, here, or there... but generally speaking, the syntax just makes sense to you).\n\nA.I. mostly serves as an aid to people who haven't reached that level. It promises to make it all easier for the learner. I'm worried it may make the beginners more dependent, actually, and lengthen the time it takes them to really get comfortable with a language. And once you get going and have reached that stage, a.i. can suggest things to you, but by then, you can do it yourself.\n\nAnd you can get A.I. to get big projects done quickly... but the devil's in the details. A.I. is going to give you a general solution. (Like make me a slider, which I got Chat GPT to do). But it's going to be 'a' slider. So then you're going to have to make things more precise... and by that time, you may as well code it yourself, because explaining to chatGPT EXACTLY what you want... well, that's basically the same thing as specifying it through code.",

Copilot is a great autocomplete tool but AI as a whole writing code from scratch is a very bad time. If you aren't using it as just an autocomplete tool it'll create bugs and then you can't fix them because you don't know what you're doing. If you are using AI as anything more than an autocomplete you will probably spend more time trying to fix problems than it would have taken you to learn to do things properly and get them right.

For example websites use Javascript and there isn't really a good way to get around that. It also doesn't change my point that you need to know what you're doing. Like Python is a generic answer but there might be a better, more specific answer if you have something particular in mind.",

The following prompt is tailored for my goals—just tailor it how you see fit. If you have any ideas, please let me know how I can adjust the prompt!\n\nYou will act as an expert machine learning engineer to guide me in becoming proficient in deep learning, aiming to qualify for Stanford's Master's in Computer Science - AI program within two years. Assuming I am beginner to programming, create an application-based learning curriculum, and organize it into semesters, units, and modules, with each module containing links to relevant resources including but not limited to videos, interactive exercises, written material, and forums. In addition to the resources provided for each module, recommend top online boot camps and courses that align with the month’s curriculum such as but not limited Stanford's Machine Learning Course. Ensure that each semester builds on the previous one for systematic progression. At the end of each unit, include an exercise to consolidate learning. At the end of each month, conclude with a detailed coding challenge and a project designed to align with the month’s curriculum, progressively increase in complexity, and specifically tailored to enhance my Stanford application. Furthermore, the projects should utilize current industry technologies, including but not limited to TensorFlow and PyTorch. Dedicate the first half of the curriculum to Python programming and the second half to machine learning while integrating foundational mathematical concepts essential for computing, including but not limited to logic, proof techniques, discrete structures, automata and complexity theory, and a rigorous treatment of NP-Completeness, alongside probability throughout. In the Python programming segment, focus on topics including but not limited to basic syntax, control structures, functions, and data handling. In the machine learning segment, ensure a balance between theoretical and practical learning. Set a review milestone every month to evaluate and adapt the educational pathway based on detailed, constructive feedback, outlining specific criteria for adjustments based on these reviews. Create the detailed curriculum for this month only, as your model tends to disregard details when writing within too large of a scope. Rather than focusing on being concise, focus on being as detailed as possible in your response to me. When this month is complete, I will return to you. ",

It’s a cheat sheet basically and once I go through it I forget about what I learned when I move to a different problem because they usually don’t have any sort of similar patterns and then the cycle continues until I just get burned out by programming. \n\nAt the same time I can’t not look at the solution because I can’t sleep at night not knowing what logic was used in solving that problem. \n\nI can’t decide if using ChatGPT is good or bad for me. Finding solutions was great at first, but now it’s become routine for me to just look at solutions rather than create them myself. It’s the most unproductive thing honestly and i cant seem to get out of this loop ive created for myself. ",

I even followed up with \"Can you provide a bit more of a hint without spelling out the answer?\" and it did a pretty good job at elaborating.\n\nFor the issues you're having, maybe telling it to suggest just the name of a data structure or algorithm that can help without having it provide any further elaboration might be the trick you need.  Then you can jump to Wikipedia and read up on the data structure on your own.  Once you're a little more comfortable, you might prefer having ChatGPT explain the data structure or algorithm to you, maybe in a fresh conversation so to ensure it's talking in general terms instead of getting a bit too helpful and using the context of your original programming problem.\n\nOf course all the usual AI caveats apply, and it might end up sending you off in the wrong direction, so it might be worth practicing this approach with a problem you've previously solved.",

It’s here that humans outperform GPT models for now.\n\nThe same thing happened when the internet took off.

Many students aren't using AI to learn effectively from what I can tell.\n\n\nI'm in an online asynchronous program with discussion board posts. It's obvious which students have been making use of AI from the start. \n\n\nThere are always three tell tale signs. \n\n\nFirst, their responses are always two or three times as long. They're changing the words given in the AI's explanation, but keeping the lengthy explanation that goes with every block. \n\n\nSecond, they're not using the tools we're learning in class to solve the task at hand. Like, we'd be in basic programming and they're using professional methods of getting user input, when the rest of the class is learning how to import a scanner.\n\n\nFinally, they have no idea when their code doesn't match up with the topic, because there is no understanding. For them it has been too tempting to use AI as a crutch instead of a tool. Their comprehension of the topics we're learning has suffered.\n\n\nFor example, we're currently studying code security and in particular comparing exception handling in Java and C++.\n\n\nSomeone proudly provided a code example with their user defined exception handling In Java. Two others commented how the user defined exception was an excellent addition to the post and really drove the point home.\n\n\nThe problem is two fold. First, the code did not include a user defined exception. Second, this is the last discussion post of the advanced programming course. This is their last coding course before graduation.\n\n\nSo, yes, AI can help to learn the fundamentals I'm sure of that as well. But, people really need to keep their goal of learning to code in mind. Because, it's entirely possible to get the idea you know what you're doing and in reality learn nothing. Many of my classmates have fallen into this trap.",

I’ll do an assignment normally if I can, and I might look at my gross newbie code after, then I can just as ChatGPT “is there a better way I can write this” and it will return to me with something simpler and more readable that I can use in the future.\n\nAt the same time the confidently wrong thing can be an issue. I’ve had instances where I’m feeding it basically beginner-level code and it still does the opposite of what I want, or the code doesn’t compile or whatever. \n\nI think the best thing teachers can do is teach how to use ChatGPT responsibly. It’s kinda like how sex ed in high school is important because if you don’t know anything about anything you can get caught up doing some really bad stuff even if it’s just by accident. Having a basic intro to AI will likely become something mandatory in the future.",

It wasn't all that useful for what was asked.\n\nThe task assignments were way too specific that you couldn't just copy and paste the entire assignment answer. They contained custom code by the department team and restrictions on what to use. The code that you handed in also had to run through a simple test suite that the department never properly revealed.\n\nJust doing the assignment tasks yourself probably was just the same effort as asking super specific questions over and over again and then getting shitty answers like \"do you own homework\" or non-specific answers before your deadline came up.\n\nCode plagiarism from teams just handing in the same exact code was also checked.\n\nWith ChatGPT (at least the unpaid version) you can get customized code but it's usually not that great and incomplete. The paid version is much better at code generation but even then, once you require specific code input that it needs to work together with, you are stuck.\n\nIf you are going through all this trouble trying to not get caught, not learn, asking weirdly specific questions and trying your hardest to copy and paste stuff together, you might as well just learn this stuff.

You do not need school for that.\n\n\nAI is the new \"reference section at the library\". Just like the internet became the new \"reference section at the library\" when I was in school. \n\nThere was a point in time when I was hearing some adults in my life discuss whether I was really learning in school if I could \"just look something up on the internet\", but it turned out that access to the internet was an accelerator to learning and enabled a lot more depth of understanding than I could have had before. It was a larger, faster library. \n\nAI obviously has a whole lot of growing to do, but it's NOT GOING ANYWHERE. It's the new librarian. It's a flawed one, sure, but if we make it cite its sources and take it with a grain of salt, it can act like a lubricant for complex analysis.",

I know for a fact that they would not be able to do the assignment themselves.\n\nIt's such a major issue that we had people get the title of excellence for the degree because they copied and bought every single test and assignment they got.\n\nThat's now how the acedemia should be. It needs to be re-evaluated and made into proper high institute where people have to prove that they know what they're doing.",

Learn to use it for the little things that it's good for, learn to appreciate its limitations.\n\nI think it's very comparable to googling things, really. There were always people copy/pasting code they didn't understand off SO, and there were always often really poor resources at the top of google results. I'm glad I was taught how to use search engines.\n\nI could see arguing that it shouldn't really be taught at all, that it doesn't add much over googling and loses some things, etc, and I'm kind of sympathetic to that myself, but I could see someone making the same arguments about teaching people search engines 25 years ago when we already had libraries.",

But if you look online people are saying it is terrible for Godot 4. They are taking what it generates at face value and when it uses a depreciated method or makes a logic error they say it's garbage. It's unusable. But it's been incredibly useful for me. Literally game changing. You just need to engage with it, be able to critically analyze what it's spitting out and modify it to suit your needs. But if you are just going to copy and paste the code and expect it to be perfect I think that is a profound misunderstanding of how it can be used. People who say how powerful it is are putting in more effort to work with it and understand how to use it. They realize it is a tool. Not a magic solution. People who complain that it is unreliable are expecting it to do all the work for them.",

Try getting a calculator to do calculus for you, or your taxes.

It's not. It's a tool. And all tools serve their purpose and can't do things that they are unable to do. AI can do a lot of things, and one thing it can't is it can't be a reliable source of facts. But that's okay, because I don't know any informed proponents that think it's presently a reliable source of fact, rather than a way to analyze concepts roughly and quickly transform text.",

                            "body": "Sure. As an example from the other day, I was trying to use asyncio in Python instead of the subprocess module. \n\nAs some background, there is a __main__ application with its own loop (sleep 2 second and print \"main\") and a second python file also with an \"infinite\" while loop, also a simple sleep for 1 second and print \"listener\".\n\nWhat would happen is main would print once and listener would continue to print, holding up the main loop. \n\nI asked chat gpt for help debugging, telling it the language then:\n\n- providing the code\n- providing an example/sample of the output\n- what the expected output should be\n\nIt responds with a fix as well as an explanation. I might respond a couple times with \"that didn't work,\" followed by the current output. \n\nAfter two iterations of code corrections, we managed to arrive at the correct implementation. After about 10 minutes of looking through docs and articles, using chatgpt in the end didn't take more than 5.\n\nI thought it was quite remarkable that it actually managed to fix the code. \n\nAs another example, I've asked it to template a pygame application, 800x600, 50 blue balls with random trajectories and speeds, as well as collisions with energy transfer. It managed it without any problem.\n\nEdit: I've also used it to generate json samples for certain application-specific GPTs, as well as dummy data. You can also perform correlations and solve physics based questions... one test (just for fun) was generating a json encoded dataset of all UEFA Europa League teams and there associated sponsors, then rankings teams by \"most sponsors\" and sponsors by \"most teams supported.\" It was kinda interesting and fun. It even asks clarifying questions! Apparently, the new GPT is way better at this sort of task, but it's 20 bucks a month.",

Worry about it how?\n\nIMO the biggest worry w/ AI is its proliferation of misinformation, it's coercion of the uninformed and it's environmental cost. If you live near a datacenter and AI isn't reeled in you may want to prepare for water shortages and other environmental changes in the near future.\n\nDatacenters already use a lot of water for cooling, but AI has massively accelerated that due to how horrible its efficiency is. This is already an issue in Oregon and Arizona and I'd expect it to expand. In Oregon, Google is using nearly 30% of the entire cities water supply for their data center and that number is from pre-AI boom numbers.\n\n[https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2022/12/googles-water-use-is-soaring-in-the-dalles-records-show-with-two-more-data-centers-to-come.html](https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2022/12/googles-water-use-is-soaring-in-the-dalles-records-show-with-two-more-data-centers-to-come.html)\n\nEdit: also going to add on here - you should expect a LOT of the new AI solutions being pushed by companies to evaporate as Microsoft, OpenAI, Google etc stop burning money to build a customer base. Once these products are priced to make a profit for those companies a lot of the current things being done with AI just don't make any sense at all.",

The point of homework isn't to produce AN answer regardless of correctness, it's to test you on your skills and get you to work practically with what they've taught.\n\nEveryone in this thread saying how ChatGPT will be an essential tool for programming in the future is buying into tech hype made up by people trying to sell their AI scheme. AI-generated text is never guaranteed to be correct and you will need to understand how any code it generates works if you want to implement it into a real program. It's way more useful to search online for answers since at least a person wrote those first and can explain what's going on.\n\nIf you do care about learning to program and learning computer science, do not by any means listen to these people.

I suspect there is more going on here than the apparent. Maybe their instance is trained to use faulty logic that you are meant to discover. Maybe this is an attempt to discover which students are interested in meeting them half-way so they'll know where to put their limited resources. Or maybe they've actually just given up in the face of a crushing world and you're burning your tuition on a rogue dead-eyed clock-puncher, asleep at the wheel.\n\nBelieve me - do not coast and do not tolerate shit courses or checked-out teachers.

You can have a CS degree and be a Walmart employee temporarily or even a corporate manager or other random jobs that you may or may not stay or for periods of time.\n\nAlso AI is crazy and gives existential dread to a lot of people.\nBut currently it's just a huge input output function that gives you some wild average based on a lot of data.\n\nDon't start being scared until its conscious 🤡\n\nAGI seems like AI but AI right now is just a fancy function. AGI is a qualitative change. Imo\n\nI think AI can still assist in a lot of jobs but it won't replace them yet. It may cut them down a bit or it might just let more industries or people create more jobs in other areas who knows.",

I have over a decade of software development experience.\n\nThis is a tool, one that is going to be everywhere, you should learn how to use well. It demands a different process from you than the one you're likely used to. Getting comfortable with that does take time. \n\nWorking out how to properly evaluate the information being given to you is really important. Being able to distinguish machine certainty from truth is paramount. For example, it's a tool you should often be asking the same question to multiple times (with clear context). You may get very different results. Especially if the question you've posed to the machine is poorly specified. Over time you will work out how to specify the problem is such a way as to get the results you're interested in. \n\nMore than ever, foundational principles are critically important. Clean code, easy to read, easy to debug. It is likely we'll all be doing a lot more reading in the future than writing, so having a good grasp on how to properly evaluate what you're getting from the AI, understand it, test it and implement it will be the skills of the future.",

So we've put together a short survey that we would love to get your help with. It's comprised of some multiple choice questions and a few free text fields for you to share your thoughts.  \nIf you have any other thoughts you would like to share, feedback or stuff that you find relevant that didn't fit in the survey, please do tell!  \nAnd we will share all of our findings with the community later in the year right here.  \nThank you!\n\n[The Use of Generative AI in the video games industry - SURVEY](https://forms.office.com/e/bRH7sZxDfZ)  \nAnd about privacy.  \nWe're required to comply with european GDPR rules so the survey is build with the Microsoft Office 365 platform and it's anonymous.",

Completing lines, scaffolding functions, auto-fill shit. It's very good at that.\n\nBefore December 23 update, it was OK to Good at completing lines and utter crap and scaffolding functions. After that update, it was Pretty Good at completing lines and became OK to Good at scaffolding. Even tho it got the context wrong much of the time, like answering the wrong question, it used internal and external methods \n\nAfter the recent updates, completing lines is the defacto use, and scaffolding is better than Pretty Good in context. If I setup variables and other basics ahead of time, then do like `async function getUserHistory() {`, it will use ORM methods and transform the resulting data in the style of the app. I'll still need to do the heavy lifting, but it does the boilerplate.\n\nOf course, I don't blanket rely on it... I always read the code before I Accept it, just like anyone should do with cargo-culting from Stack.\n\nAnd that's the current/early point with these things, no different than power tools or a sewing machine: automating the tedium so that experienced people can Get Things Done.\n\nBefore december it was saving me an hour a week. After December it was saving me 2-3. Now it's north of 5hrs a week. . . 15mins at a time.\n\nI say all of this because the result is that I don't have to use SO near as much as I used to. The LLM auto-fill is on target enough that I don't have the problems I used to. Drive and get lost, vs taking a bus. When I do need reference or tshooting help, it's gotten to the point to where the thing I need help on is deep/obscure enough that Stack doesn't have many good answers anyway.",

        "selftext": "I want to build a product that organises folders/subfolders and files automatically based on their files names and clustering them into groups based on similarity of file names. I know this can be tackled with an LLM, specifically ChatGPT4 but this presents a few issues. 1. Privacy, not everyone will want to send their file names to this system. 2. Input length, the OpenAI context window is limited to a certain length so if you had a folder with 1000 files or more it will not be able to process this. 3. Token cost, even if you could process 1000 files or more this would start getting very expensive. For this reason I am looking for an alternative. (A local LLM could solve the privacy concerns but wouldn't address problem 2).\n\n  \nI am sure there are machine learning techniques that exist that can cluster words together based on the similarity of the meaning behind the words but I haven't been able to find a library that does what I need out of the box.\n\n  \nHere is an example of what I want to achieve:\n\n  \nInput (file names):  \nhistoryHomework.pdf  \nreports.docx  \nmountains.png  \nhistoryTest.docx  \nweatherdata.csv  \ngeographynotes.docx  \nartwork1.png  \nartwork2.png\n\nOutput (proposed folder names):  \nHistory  \nGeography  \nArt  \nOther\n\nNote that the output folders are not pre-determined groups. For instance the input could be 10 other random files, and the algorithm you should suggest new names based on the inputs.  \n\n\nThe closest solution I came to was using WordNet in python and finding hypernyms to group words. The problem is it wasn't very accurate.",

When I was first learning, I had issues too. SO answers made no sense because I didn’t yet understand the context and how to apply it to my own project.\n\nAre you taking a course/schooling, or just trying to start with a personal project on your own? If the latter, I highly recommend doing something like free code camp to get the basics down. Even better, keep going on your personal project WHILE doing FCC. You’ll start to see quicker progress because you’re learning in a proven order to strengthen your understanding, and get the satisfaction of completing a project that wasn’t just a tutorial.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with Chat GPT/Gemini or Stack Overflow. There are great tools to help you learn and improve, so long as they are used to learn, not to just do your work for you. Keep going, you got this! And share your projects as you work on them! It’s very motivating to talk to like-minded  people about things that are exciting to you!",

You're just in the mindset that a programmer must struggle so that only other industries can automate their jobs, but programmers have been improving the ease of their job since programming began. \n\nOP depends on AI, so what?

No one is using it for that, and if they are, they quickly find the limitations of the tool because you absolutely CAN assess the quality of a solution using other tools. Tools that AI can teach you how to use. \n\nAlso, why do you think the only form of programming is coming up with unique solutions? Most programmers aren't coming up with anything new. For every novel product/solution out there, there are a hundred clones that only tweak the original design. No one on those projects came up with their own solutions but they're still programmers.\n\nTo be a professional programmer, you either have to be insanely creative and clever to craft unique solutions with what you know, OR be constantly *learning* about new tools in the industry and how they are used. Most professionals are a mix of both.  \n\nA beginner has an EXTREMELY limited knowledge of existing tools. The solutions they come up with on their own won't be useful to them or anyone else. Most beginners learn bad habits by doing this. They'll use zero style guide and have all their code in one class. AI let's them see what good code is meant to look like. AI isn't always right but it's way better than most beginners. So it can show beginners how to do it the standard way. The AI will give them buggy code, they are forced to learn debugging. They also learn how to ask better questions because AI isn't a mind reader.",

        "selftext": "Lately, I've been playing around with some front end HTML/CSS kinds of things.  That's hardly my strength.  I know some stuff, but not how to get a UI to work.  However, I do know other programming languages, Java, most notably.\n\nWhile I think \"AI\" (and I use that loosely) is bad for intro programmers who don't know what they don't know, but just want answers to their programming problems, for someone who has more programming knowledge but is weak in some spots, then AI can help.\n\nWhy does it work well?  First, AIs seem to understand even vague sentences, but the more precise you can be, the better.  Second, it can handle context.  \n\nFor example, recently I had the following kind of discussion.  I asked the AI to make a button that could submit a form.  It did that.  Then I wanted to add a cancel button.  It did that.  Then, I wanted these two buttons in a modal for yet another button and for the modal to disappear once the button was either submitted or canceled.  It did that.\n\nIt took a while for me to realize I needed a form to submit a request because the answers I had prior to this interaction didn't mention a form.\n\nBut through a series of questions where I had *some* idea of where to go, I could get an answer (that hopefully works).  By contrast, Googling for this would have been a mess.  It wouldn't answer my exact question and I couldn't lead it to the answer I want.\n\nI've used it to make some basic programs in a language I wanted to learn.  It used syntax I was unfamiliar with, so I can question that.\n\nI think this will be a tool, just like Google, to help programmers more quickly get the answers they want.\n\nWhat would really be nice is if AI could develop a nicer language to work with (and that seems beyond its abilities).  I looked at my button example and it looks just awful.  It's unnecessarily complicated.  But HTML/JS wasn't meant to create these kinds of GUI applications.  They were meant for somewhat more static pages.",

                "body": "AI can be a useful tool for learning the basics of a new language, but there are a couple big flaws which hold it back from becoming a really great tool.\n\nFirst of all, it gets less accurate the more advanced you try to get. If you ask it how to make a form with javascript it will have plenty of good information because everyone and their mom has made a tutorial in javascript forms. However if you try to ask it how to use CSS to achieve a very specific outcome it will typically not give you exactly what you want.\n\nAnd most critically, AI won’t tell you when you’re asking the wrong questions. If you go into a conversation with some sort of pre-existing misconception, instead of intelligently identifying what’s wrong in your thinking like a human tutor would, it will just get confused and start spouting misleading information. For example, I just asked bing copilot how do I create a variable in HTML, and instead of explaining that HTML is not a programming language and doesn’t have variables, it told me to use the <var> tag.\n\nI would treat AI as an alternative Stack Overflow. It’s still not nearly as intelligent as human tutors, but it can respond to your questions much faster and possibly more politely.",

It's *really* hard to get the expert advice of \"you can't do what you're talking about, the language wasn't built for that...you should do this instead of that\".  But, doing web search doesn't help with that either.  \n\nWhat AIs do is to aggregate some knowledge together.  I don't expect it to teach me advanced features, but having learned some languages before, I'd rather not read syntax, but I'd rather see some code written, and have it explained.  \n\nI've taught beginning programming, so I understand a bottom up approach that's syntax driven.  But just as many beginners want to know how to write programs beyond syntax, I want to know how to write programs in a language in that style rather than do the equivalent of a word-for-word translation of English to some other language which is what I'd think of doing if I didn't see some code examples.\n\nSo, I agree.  It's something to get me started to understand a new language in a way I feel suits me even if advanced questions can't really be answered.  Obviously, a good book would help, but they tend to follow the \"here's the syntax, now you figure out how to write a program\" that is typical of many programming books.  They should be called syntax books than *programming* books, but I digress.",

If your code (that was produced by AI) breaks in production and you're unable to explain why you made certain design choices because you actually did not design it, management and your team will question your knowledge.

And of course software engineering is more complex than just simple coding, but you are putting yourself at a huge disadvantage by not learning how to code/engineer things yourself.",

If I let it do more than that, it usually writes pure trash. I can just never open up enough files to give it context. I have tried asking it to generate code using all the context I can think of to speed up my work, to basically no avail (I thought it was using GPT-4 for those requests, so I was surprised it was so far off).\n\nIf it does happen to generate something good, I still have to read it so it barely saves time and turns my job into code review.\n\nIt is good for asking questions, except I have no idea what version of the documentation it was trained on. So my basic workflow of keeping certain documentation open and available is unchanged, as it is guaranteed to be what I need.\n\nIf I have no idea what's going wrong and just have a weird error message or something, then it really shines as a therapist.

Also a father of a 3 year old and 1-1/2 year old. My wife stays home because it’s cheaper than her having a job and paying for daycare (and my measly 62k salary at this company that literally is the definition of “we are a family” mentality where after two straight high scoring performance reviews I’m seeing shit-all chances of a meaningful raise because my supervisor who has been there 20+ years makes the same amount I do, has us living “car repair to car repair”). \n\nIt’s a hobby in the lightest of terms as I’m doing as much legwork as I can to turn this from a hobby into a new career path \n\nI’ve been using the free version of GPT as a (basically) a tutor to coexist with my studies throughout my personally designed study schedule using sources listed above. I study mainly at work and a few hours at night after the wife is asleep (if I don’t pass out because I’m tired.\n\nI’ve been debating on using the 20 bucks a month version and exploring what it has to offer me. Specifically if there are any custom GPTs designed to help with learning these languages as well as CS in general to help with me creating and manifesting a better understanding or foundation. \n\nAnyone have experience with it? Also wouldn’t mind some encouragement on seeking this with my end goal being getting a job. Not even like eff-you money job, just something normal that pays more than what I make now you know? I’m done with this company I work for and although I take pride in what I do, programming and everything that goes with it is such a blast and engages my mind in a rewarding way. I see such doom and gloom about AI making the field a useless path or the job market shrinking and such.\n\nThanks for reading and would love your input and any possible tips beside the ones I’ve read everywhere else on here :)\n\nCheers",

I'm relatively new to Python and don't know much beyond the basics (variables, loops, logical operators ...) - I learned these on a course of python for data analysis (it focused on pandas, matplotlib, etc).  \nCurrently, I'm working in a project that uses the YouTube API to practice and learn more of what can be done on python. Obviously I'm using ChatGPT alongside the API documentation.  \nI've seen in this subreddit a bit of controversy regarding the use of ChatGPT, with two \"extreme\" sides: the \"copypasters\" and the \"only-typers.\" What are your thoughts on a good middle point in using ChatGPT?  \nMy current approach is asking it a step-by-step guide for my mini-project without actual code. Obviously since I don't know how to script the code myself from scratch typically I ask it for code snippets AND a detailed explanations of each segment, to be able to understand each part - I also ask additional questions that arise. I also make it a point to manually type the code in VSCode and not copy/paste it to at least stay mindful of what I am doing.  \nI'm keen to hear your thoughts and how you integrate ChatGPT learning programming or specific libraries.",

This is all that programming is about.\n\nWhat you are currently doing is outsourcing exactly that key part.\n\nLooking at the detailed explanations will not help as much as when you rack your brain and work on the steps - and then on the code.\n\nWhat you are currently doing is akin to looking at a picture and trying to learn painting from that.

You don't even see the *algorithm*, the *step-by-step* solution *behind* the code.\n\nYou have to understand that *code* as an *implementation in a programming language* is only the *final product*, the conclusion of a long train of thoughts and considerations.\n\nIn short: you are outsourcing the thinking to a third party that may or may not be available when you need it.",

For simple things, yeah an LLM can do it, but when you get into more complex problems, only you know the nuances of the project and tech stack you are working on, so you need to be able to analyze and solution in that space.\n\nI personally don't trust LLM's analysis of API's or systems as I've had it hallucinate functionality that doesn't exist or give me completely wrong configurations than what I asked for. So in your case, for the Youtube API, I would absolutely double check everything against the actual docs and your own experimentation. I do admit, it can nice for ideation, like  you said, ie. give me 5 tools similar to xyz and then you can go look them up yourself and see if they are a good fit.\n\nThis is my opinion, so maybe not a widely held view, but the middle ground comes when you are more experienced and have already gotten good at investigating the unknown. For example, I was recently looking up how to send images to an API and I used CGPT to write some boilerplate to convert the image to base64. Or I'm working in three different languages now and I don't remember the exact syntax for Python this thing I know I can do in Typescript. But the solutioning, analysis, problem solving, is still mainly done by me and my teammates.",

        "selftext": "\r  \nHey guys, I'm almost completely new to coding. I did a bit of robotics and in high school decades ago and I spread sheet casually, but I'm wanting to get into some heavier stuff for fun. \r  \n\r  \nI'm particularly looking for the capacity to create overlays and helpers for a game I play called Marvel Snap. There are quite a few such overlays already freely available which read the game state and keep a record of what cards have been played. They're not cheating because they only show parts of the game that are visible to both players. \r  \n\r  \nI'm wondering how I would go about reading this game state and what programming language you might recommended to someone who wanted to build something with that data. \r  \n\r  \nI also love the idea of using Chat GPT to help me write parts of the code considering I have a very strong understanding of the basic logic/pseudo code I would be using. Hopefully it can help me translate into whatever language you guys recommend. \r  \n\r  \nIt's also worth noting that I'm a keen follower of the Comma.ai/Openpilot open source development community. I actually help moderate the Facebook group. Some day I'd also like to use these skills to actually contribute to that project too. \r  \n\r  \nSo with this in mind, what language/languages would you guys recommend for a total beginner for the game overlay project? Python seems like a good place to start?\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm a university student working on a project to create a personalized AI assistant, inspired by the likes of BMO and Jarvis. I believe all the tech with AI renders the project possible. My current plan involves gathering personal data in Obsidian.md files and fine-tuning an existing Large Language Model (potentially Dolphin Mixtral) to understand and interact based on this data. As I'm relatively new to LLMs, AI, and Python, I'm seeking insights or references to similar projects, especially regarding the integration of personal data with LLMs and fine-tuning techniques. Any guidance or resources would be greatly appreciated! I just want to make sure I'm on the right track for this project.  \nThanks and let me know!",

        "selftext": " am not a programmer at all. I've wanted to learn how to program for maybe the last few years, and I've read a few tutorials, well the beginnings of them and it was just too dry for me to pick up. I've always had something in mind that I wanted to program, but I just didn't know how to program.\r  \n\r  \nEverybody knows about the classic intro \"Hello World\" that is your first program, but I felt like this wasn't even a program. After I got my first simple program that wasn't as trivial as \"Hello World\" this really put a light bulb over my head. I can definitely see how and why chatGPT is a cheat - and I keep calling this a cheat code to life - but I feel that I am not limited to what I don't know anymore.\r  \n\r  \nI get the whole problem solving side of things but I can still get chatGPT to do this, and in different ways. So I don't get all this bash on chatGPT not being a good thing, because I've honestly done wonders at least from where I was just 6 -7 months ago without it. I feel like some sort of software developer - mind you I work in a factory breaking my back everyday.\r  \n\r  \nOf course if they turn the tap off on chatGPT than I'm screwed somewhat, or am I? Just a few months ago I was bragging to all my peers about being able to make all these programs that I've made without understanding a single line of code. A month later I'm starting to understand the blocks of code, within a few weeks, I've started to understand it line by line. Now I'm starting to understand the code more and more - still can't write it but I don't want to bother with syntax and punctuation, I'm a lot more worried with the logic of what I need so I just don't get how people are bashing chatGPT so much.\r  \n\r  \nI get that most people probably went to school for it and have a bias on how they learned on how to attack and solve a problem and that might be correct but if I can come to the same answer of a problem than I don't see what the big deal is.\r  \n\r  \nI've been spewing this stuff out, especially to my co-workers, and you can probably imagine what that looks like in a factory setting. I've been ranting on and on about this and I have nowhere else to talk about it. I've read all the FAQs in this thread and realized not one of them is an actual problem to me. I can learn and DO in multiple languages and can build out programs almost with ease. This is incredible. I feel like chatGPT is my NZT from Limitless only that I don't experience the burnout.\r  \n\r  \nI wonder if it was possible for me to land a job like this? I want to step back for a second and re-state what I said. \"I am not limited to what I don't know anymore\" - I think this is a revolutionary statement because I can see how this statement has changed the way that I think. If programming is all about problem solving and these already existing programmers feel that this takes away the problem solving function of your brain, then I feel that it is me that is on their tail and ready to take over their job or better yet their company. (Or how about the world!? - just kidding)",

(Or how about the world!? - just kidding)\n\nYou're not taking it to the logical conclusion. If ChatGPT were so good that you could program without ever using your brain, then why hire even you? What are you contributing? Businesses would just use ChatGPT and cut out the middleman.\n\nStill, ChatGPT makes a lot of mistakes, and that only increases the more complex your task and the larger your codebase. Eventually you'll have to solve the problems it creates.\n\nUntil we get true AGI that can actually think, there will be a need for human thought, for us to actually use our brains, to be creative. Deciding now that you don't need to develop your skill of thinking is not just unwise, there is something fundamentally repulsive about that attitude. Problem solving isn't just some obsolete skill that you can mock others for having honed — it is a core part of what makes us human.\n\nIf you can build the thing you want to with just ChatGPT, that's actually a great use of it and I'm happy for you, but don't confuse it for something greater. Don't atrophy yourself.",

If you copy another dev's code to solve your problem, and don't care about the \"how\", the problem will be solved and your boss will be happy.  \n\n\nHowever, there are a few fundamental problems here:  \n\\- one day, your boss will realize you don't really add much value, and they will hire that other dev - especially because you will get more and more expensive as you get more senior, and that other dev will get cheaper and cheaper because it runs on commodity hardware  \n\\- Until that happens, that dev is not concerned about things like scalability, efficiency, tech debt, etc. That other dev is also not accountable for it. Once you build a real-world application based on patchwork code, and then have to maintain it for years, you'll get it.  \n\\- That dev is stupid. Yes, I'll say it again: in it's current format, ChatGPT is incapable of original ideas. It's basically Google on a lot of steroids: you give it a prompt, and based on what it saw online from other (mostly real people) devs, it guesses what you want as an answer. It's not creating new code. It's just recombining other people's code. So, once you, me, and everyone else is replaced by ChatGPT v2025, we could reach a distopia where basically there's no real new content - it's just the same thing rehashed over and over again  \n\\- Last but not least: ChatGPT is wrong often, and it has no clue about it unless you tell it. And likewise, if it is correct, and you tell it it's not, it will \"fold\" quickly. Again: it doesn't \"think\", it just spits out what you think you want to hear.",

It is certainly very useful to give you an idea for something or to show the basic structure of something you're trying to do, but it's not going to do your job for you. You absolutely need to have an understanding of code and how to read and write it. I get that coding is complex and hard to understand for just about anyone but it's like any other job wherein the more time you spend interacting with it the more familiar it becomes. ChatGPT is not going to be able to do everything for you and as you said, what happens if access to it is suddenly cut off? Then the one thing you relied on to get you by is gone and you're screwed. Don't depend on it.",

Members of Star Fleet are able to ask the computer to create programs simply by asking it to perform certain tasks just as developers build apps and programs using code. But the highly skilled people in Star Fleet know how that computer works and how to program it in just the right way to get the exact outcome they were looking for.\n\nSimilarly we as programmers must understand what AI provides for us. If you don't understand the code it helps you write, you won't be able to debug.\n\nI took am learning and if there is code that I get from AI that I don't understand, I ask it to explain that code like by line so I can get a better understanding of why it was written like that.\n\nI also like to use the prompt, \"Please refactor this code to reflect best practices\" so I can see how a professional would write/organize the code I have written. It has helped me to write much cleaner/repeatable code than I could have on my own.",

Every failure, every near crushing defeat where you do the wrong thing for days before figuring it out is vastly more useful to learning than the easy successes of asking someone (or something thing) else how to do it. The only resources you should be using are instruction manuals/tutorials written by humans, academic materials (for deeper theory) and other more experienced people (teachers, colleagues, experts, etc. either in person or on the internet). \n\nYour focus should be understanding what you are doing, not just in accomplishing a task. Take for example databases, since you brought it up. If the help you seek is \"tell me how to design this database for my current project\" then you are wasting your time. The help you seek from others should be \"how do I design a good database\".\n\nAlso, if you think you can't provide answers on the spot in an interview, you don't actually know anything (barring some individuals with legitimate pathologies).",

I was tasked with building a client stub that would send a soap request via https to an external server. ChatGPT gave me a suggestion which helped me get started.\n\n2) Giving clarification when official documentations is either lacklustre or extremely condensed with technical jargon I've yet to familiarize myself with.\n\nThe big takeaway from using ChatGPT is what other people in this thread has alluded to: it's ok to use if your goal is to understand whatever solution the AI presents. Just copy-pasting will not make you learn, and to properly understand you will need to cross check with official documentation and other sites since AI answers can be a bit iffy at times. Using AI tools this way will increase your knowledge about concepts, languages, and frameworks which in turn will help you explain your work in a way that other developers will recognize.\n\nHope that helps!",

Their work usually involves finding out methods to do so, and in the end, sum it all up in a research paper which might impact the models being used for that task (I have checked out a couple of research papers on the OpenAI website). But I am not clear about what happens after that.\r  \n\r  \nMy question is : Once the researchers develop a model, publish papers that present a method to improve performance of a ML task. What do the engineers at the organizations do ? Is my conception of the role of a researcher at these companies correct ?\r  \n\r  \nI am a CS undergrad and I find the recent developments in AI very interesting.

Researchers aren't just thinking of abstract ideas, doing math and writing a paper.\n\nTo see if an idea works, they have to implement that idea in code. An idea that takes one paragraph and three equations to describe might take 10,000 lines of code and a month of work to implement, then they might need to train the model for a week to see what happens.\n\nAnd the \"first\" idea they think of rarely works. They might try hundreds of ideas that fail before hitting upon one that seems to improve the model performance, then they might have to iterate dozens of times on that idea - each time waiting a week for the model to train - before learning whether that iteration worked better or not.\n\nResearchers at an AI company are all engineers too. They all write lots of code.\n\nHowever, there are also many other engineers who do supportive work to make that research possible, tasks such as:\n\n* Building web crawlers and scrapers to get training data - ChatGPT 4 was trained on over 500 GB of data, for example\n* Writing custom GPU code to make model training and evaluation more efficient\n* Automating the work of taking models and uploading them to server farms where models can be trained and evaluated on hundreds of cpus and gpus in parallel\n* Building software to explore why some models work better than others - visualizing embeddings, exploring mistakes made and tracing them back to why\n\nIn many cases, the line between research and engineering is blurred. Researchers spend a lot of time doing engineering work - writing code and tests, making the software work. And engineers often come up with research ideas and contribute to research papers.",

Arrays are a fundamental part of the C++ language, and their functionality is included in the <array>, <vector>, and <algorithm> headers, among others, depending on the type of array you are using. (...)\"\n\nSo to conclude has anyone had a similar contradicting experience?\n\nOh and by the way, why is there an array header if i don't need to use it? What am i missing here?",

                "body": "AI chat tools will routinely hallucinate nonsense and cannot be depended on to reliably give correct answers. You should always treat whatever they produce with skepticism and double-check with reliable resources.\n\nAnyways, the answer to your question is that C-style arrays are baked into the core language rules and can be used without depending on any library. C-style arrays are declared by doing something like `int[] foo = {1, 2, 3};`.\n\nThe problem is that C-style arrays were inherited from the C programming language and so came with some baggage that made them not necessarily the best fit within modern C++. For example, C-style arrays will decay into pointers, it doesn't support standard container methods like `.size()/.front()/.back()`...\n\nThe C++ language designers decided to solve this inconvenience by creating a new [std::array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array) class, which was added in C++11 (the version of C++ standardized in 2011). To use this alternative type of array, you need to include the 'array' standard library by doing  `#include <array>` then declare a variable of type `std::array` by doing something like `std::array<int, 3> bar = {1, 2, 3};`\n\nGoogling things like \"c-style array vs std::array\" will bring up more details.\n\nA few more details/notes:\n\n1. The reason why the C++ language designers did not choose to just modify C-style arrays to better fit with C++ is because one of the design goals for C++ is to maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility. The C++ community really wants to ensure that any code that compiled in an older version of C++ will continue to compile in the same way in a newer version. This makes it very hard, if not impossible, for the C++ language to ever modify or drop support for something.\n2. In general, if you want to figure out if you need to include some library, I would start by checking what specifically that library contains and see any of it is useful to you. For example, googling \"C++ array library\" should bring you to https://cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/ and https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array. It can admittedly take some careful reading to fully grok everything in a reference doc, but even skimming it should give you some clues as to what the library is for and if it's useful to you.",

                            "body": "> I actually use those 2 reference sites and i still find it incredibly confusing.\n\nHonestly, this is pretty reasonable -- I remember also being very confused by those websites when I started learning programming.\n\nThose references (and C++ in general) only really started clicking for me after I detoured for a few years to go learn other programming languages and tried making my own mini-language. With that context, it was suddenly a lot more clear what C++ was trying to do: I could start picking out the core idea behind the layer of C++ magic.\n\nThat's probably not very practical advice for you though lol.\n\n> It is funny that the book i am reading (C++ Primer Fifth Edition) is for C++11 but makes until now no reference to std::array.\n\nFrom a pedagogical point of view, I think it's actually fairly reasonable to focus on C-style arrays first:\n\n1. Teaching std::array requires you to introduce several different concepts first, such as the concept of a standard library, how to include modules, generics... C-style arrays have fewer prereq concepts, so it might be better to teach that first to avoid overloading the student.\n2. You are inevitably going to run into C-style arrays in the wild, so it needs to be taught.\n3. Teaching std::array raises some circularity questions -- how would you go about implementing your own version of it from scratch? A teacher could always handwave this away, but some students won't be satisfied/be comfortable until they know how std::array works under the hood.\n\n> Modern C++ programs should use the library containers rather than more primitive structures like arrays.\"\n\nI don't have the book on hand to check, but I'm guessing it's also probably referring to containers such as vectors and maps/unordered_maps. That is:\n\n1. A sequence of items where you can keep adding new items indefinitely (or until you run out of memory)\n2. A mapping of key-value pairs where you can efficiently look up the value given a key\n\nIn most programs, there actually is not much reason to use fixed-sized arrays, whether it's C-style arrays or std::arrays. It turns out relatively few real-world programs accept a genuinely fixed amount of data that is known at compile-time. They almost always operate over an indefinite amount of data provided by the user instead.\n\nThe two main places where it does make sense to use fixed-size arrays are:\n\n1. As building blocks to build basic data structures such as vectors and maps.\n2. When you are building something that needs to process a large quantity of data, ideally in fixed-sized chunks for perf. \n\nBut in most cases, it'll be easier to just use some library that implements both of the above for you instead of hand-rolling your own thing.",

I realized that if I had something to pull me out of the void and help me refocus on my goals, I could use my time more wisely. \n\nThe proposed solution:\nCreate a software that allows me to interact with ChatGPT via iMessage. iMessage important so that chatGPT can ‘text’ me and it feels like a friend is texting me right before I sink into a YouTube spiral. The software knows my free time based on being connected to my calendar. The software keeps a log of my conversations with chatGPT so that it continues learning what my goals are.\n\nMy questions:\nHow should I build this? Has this already been done?

The right goal is to learn from mistakes and figure out how to keep mistakes from having too much impact on your system and your users. \n\nSo, how does this mindset apply to GPT?  Well, sometimes it will give you a really insightful gem about Neolithic Java that exactly answers your question and would have taken hours to figure out on your own, and sometimes it will give you hallucinated nonsense that embed insidious false assumptions that will poison your whole approach. This tool is **very dangerous and bad** if you take its answers as the definitive truth. However, if you get in the habit of viewing the answers critically, confirming them on your own, testing what you’re being told, etc., then it becomes an incredibly valuable tool. When it’s wrong, you lose 10 minutes and maybe learn something in the process. When it’s right, you save hours.\n\nThis is an example of the crucial metaskill of taking inputs of highly variable quality and producing outputs that reliably move the ball in generally the right direction.

It can even draw diagrams. \n\nBut it can give inaccurate information as well. And so I would say to not just 100% trust everything it outputs, especially for people who are completely new to programming. Use Google as well to confirm things.\n\nCGPT has been so good that it's the only thing I use now when I need to understand something code related. But there have been times when I was like \"hang on, that doesn't really sound right\". And then I use Google to confirm. But pretty much 98% of the time, it's correct, at least from my experience. \n\nJust use it because it makes your life easier. Why make things hard for yourself. But I think it's important for beginners to use other resources as well just because CGPT can give false information too.",

LLMs literally have no way of reasoning or giving accurate output, they can only determine what sequence of words is statistically likely to appear.\n\nAnd 2) doesn't help, because the more context an LLM understands, the more chance it has to screw up and wander down the wrong path.

        "selftext": "I have started to learn Python recently, I'm understanding basics as solid as possible, hence my question:  \nWhile learning the use of \"break\" clause to break an infinite loop, I came to notice that its working in both of the following scenarios: when its within or outside the \"if\" code block:  \n**- Scenario 1 placing \"print\" outside the \"if\" block, works as expected**  \n`while True:`  \n`print(\"Please type your name.\")`  \n`name = input()`  \n`if name == \"your name\":`  \n`break`  \n`print(\"Thank you!\")`  \n**- Scenario 2 placing \"print\" inside the \"if\" block, should not work but works unexpectedly**  \n`while True:`  \n`print(\"Please type your name.\")`  \n`name = input()`  \n`if name == \"your name\":`  \n`break`  \n`print(\"Thank you!\")`  \n***I have tried Chat GPT to get help and understand, and tried its suggestions as well, please see the Chat GPTs response below:***  \n**Chat GPT Response**  \nI see what you're getting at. Let's break down the behavior of each code snippet:  \nCode 1:  \n`while True:`  \n`print('Please type your name.')`  \n`name = input()`  \n`if name == 'your name':`   \n`break`  \n`print('Thank you!')`\n\n  \nIn Code 1, the print('Thank you!') is outside the loop. Here's how it behaves:  \n\"Please type your name.\" is displayed.  \nIt waits for the user input.  \nIf the user types \"your name\", the loop is exited because of the break statement.  \nAfter exiting the loop, \"Thank you!\" is printed.  \nSo, no matter what you enter, once you break out of the loop (by entering \"your name\"), \"Thank you!\" will be printed.  \nCode 2:  \n`while True:`  \n`print('Please type your name.')`  \n`name = input()`  \n`if name == 'your name':`   \n`break`  \n`print('Thank you!')`  \nIn Code 2, the print('Thank you!') is indented to be inside the if block but after the break statement. Here's its behavior:  \n\"Please type your name.\" is displayed.  \nIt waits for the user input.  \nIf the user types \"your name\", the break statement is executed, which exits the loop.  \nThe print('Thank you!') statement inside the if block will never be executed because it's after the break.  \nIn conclusion:  \nCode 1 will always print \"Thank you!\" after you type \"your name\" and exit the loop.  \nCode 2 will never print \"Thank you!\", regardless of what you enter.  \nIf you're observing different behavior, there might be something external affecting the execution or display. Ensure you're running the code in a standard Python environment without any modifications.  \nThat behavior is indeed unexpected for standard Python execution. The Mu editor is designed to be a beginner-friendly Python editor, and it generally adheres to Python's standards. However, there are a few possibilities to consider:  \nBuffering or Caching: Sometimes, IDEs and editors can have buffered outputs or caching that might cause previous outputs to appear even when they shouldn't. Restarting the editor or running the code multiple times in succession might help clear any buffered outputs.  \nErrors in the Code Window: There might be inadvertent code outside the displayed window or multiple active code tabs. Ensure that there's no extra code running, and you're viewing and executing the correct code tab.  \nEditor Bugs: While Mu is a reliable editor, no software is without its potential issues. There could be a bug or unusual behavior in the version of Mu you're using, especially if it's showing outputs that defy standard Python behavior.  \nInterpreter Issues: Mu uses its bundled Python interpreter. There could be unique configurations or behaviors in that specific interpreter.",

I did well last semester, but the difficulty REALLY ramped up, so I unwisely started using ChatGPT early this semester to code the weekly coding assignments for me so I could keep a good grade.\n\nBecause of this, I’ve dug myself into a hole. I was lazy, and now I don’t know how to code without a crutch. I’m screwed if I continue like this, as if I want a tech career, I need to know my shit. Therefore, I need to catch up as soon as possible.\n\nAfter realizing this, I took the time to catch up on all of the textbook work, so I now understand the general concepts. However, I don’t know how to put it into practice and actually code it, which is the important part.\n\nMy current plan is to just go through the weekly coding assignments from the beginning week by week and try to code them on my own. However, this will take a while, as they aren’t easy assignments.\n\nAre there any tips you all recommend to catch up and gain a solid foundation as soon as possible?",

                "body": "Hmm.\n\nI got my bachelors in not-software engineering a decade ago and was  admittedly a shit student.  Crammed for almost every exam I had, so knowledge retention was terrible.  Still, I survived and had an okay understanding of course materials.\n\nUnfortunately, I find programming just isn't something you can cram or shortcut your way out of.  Yeah, you can cram the theory-heavy stuff, but when it comes to actually putting something together it just doesn't work.  It's like only knowing how to chop up ingredients on a cutting board but never really experiencing how to *put together a good tasting dish.*  There's also a dozen spices in your cupboard, but how do you mix them together to get a coherent taste?  And how much of each, or if any?  You gotta mix them up, make a mess, taste and evaluate them.\n\nI'm afraid there just isn't any shortcuts compared to other engineering fields, where you can (but not recommended, as I've experienced) \"plug and chug\".  You have to put in effort and familiarize through bridging them neurons.  Only then can you get a grasp of the flow of things.",

Falling behind can happen to anyone, but the important thing is to take action, and you're on the right path.\n\nYour plan to go through the weekly coding assignments from the beginning is a good one. \nHere are some additional tips to help you catch up and build a solid foundation:\n\nPractice Regularly: Consistent practice is key to becoming proficient in coding. Set aside time daily or weekly to work on coding problems.\n\nBreak It Down: For each assignment, break it down into smaller tasks. Start by solving the simpler parts and gradually build up to the more complex ones.\n\nSeek Help: Don't hesitate to ask for help when you're stuck. Your college likely has resources like tutors or coding labs. Online communities and forums like Stack Overflow can also be valuable.\n\nOnline Courses and Tutorials: Supplement your learning with online courses and tutorials. Websites like Codecademy, Coursera, and edX offer Python courses.\n\nDebugging Skills: Learning how to debug your code is crucial. Understanding error messages and using debugging tools will save you a lot of time.\n\nPersonal Projects: Try working on small personal coding projects. This can be a great way to apply what you've learned and gain practical experience.\n\nVersion Control: Get familiar with version control systems like Git. They'll help you keep track of your code changes and collaborate with others.\n\nRead Others' Code: Reading other people's code can be a valuable learning experience. You can find open-source projects on platforms like GitHub.\n\nStay Informed: Stay updated with Python's latest developments and best practices. The tech field evolves, and staying current is important.\n\nPatience: Learning to code takes time and persistence. Don't get discouraged by challenges; they're all part of the learning process.\n\nRemember, it's okay to struggle and make mistakes along the way. That's how you learn and improve. You've got this, and with determination, you can regain your coding skills and build a strong foundation. Good luck!",

Python was not my first programming language, so take this with a grain of salt, but I was able to dedicate my free time outside of work hours to work through the MOOC and finished the first half \"Introduction to Programming\" section in only a couple weeks. I'm sure it'll take you much longer as it is your first programming language, but I felt like the course material was very straightforward and to the point.\n\nMaybe you can try and supplement your class curriculum with the MOOC in order to gain a good base understanding of Python and maybe the coding assignments will be more manageable",

If your main goal is to get a certain GPA, it'll be hard for you to stay honest and keep doing your own work when things get tough. If your goal is to learn the material and become a competent coder, then you'll always be doing your best anyway, because you want to be the best coder you can be. If that means you fail a class or two, so be it. It's better to have to retake a class than to progress to the next class without really understanding the prerequisite material. Doing that will not serve you well if you make it to graduation and start looking for a job.",

I don't code in my daily life since I'm currently a systems engineer/admin.  \n\n\n I ran into some of Mosh's Youtube videos while trying to remind myself how C++ works. I bought his C++ course on his website and got caught up fairly quick. I also bought his python course because I also had Advanced Python coming up and it had been even longer since I took the basic Python course. I don't know how much it costs right now, but when I bought it, he had a deal going on where each course was only $20 for perpetual use.\n\nIf you do use a tool like chatGPT, try reverse engineering the code to get an understanding how each part works. This will come in handy in Data Structures and Algorithms, if you haven't taken that class yet.",

                "body": "I'm a 10+ years programmer who recently started using GitHub copilot. For someone like me, it is _extremely_ helpful.  I am able to prompt copilot to scaffold unit tests and write moderately complex bash scripts, and it's inline code suggestions more often help than not. But there is a big big caveat here which is my experience helps me know if the AI is getting it right or not. My own experience helps me prompt the AI as well, since I know what I need to ask. \n\nI recommend you not necessarily give up on using AI -- it _will_ help every programmer here develop faster -- but you still need to study hard to make sure you understand every line of code the AI is recommending you. Otherwise I guarantee you will submit some wildly inaccurate and illogical program that your teacher will only say \"you didn't code this\".\n\nAlso, prompt engineering is very much going to be a skill on its own, like drafting product requirements for human engineers.",

I also wrote there that DONT give me direct answers to problems, but rather guide me to finding right solutions on my own. Explain things in detail, and provide additional information related to things i listed as my topics in my courses. It has helped so much. I learn things quickly and can apply the stuff ive learned. Custom instructions are handy because every time i ask gpt something it follows those instructions as a guideline. \n\nI dont really understand people who tell you to not use it.

Find someone in your life who is not in CS, whether that’s a partner or a friend or study buddy, who is willing to listen to you rant about computing, and then make a habit of meeting with them and summarizing what you learned after each class. The act of retelling will not only help you move that knowledge into long-term memory, it will actually help you understand it better as you form new associations in order to explain it to your friend, and it will also make it quite obvious when you don’t understand a topic very well, at which point it may be time to seek out your TA/professor to ask questions.",

But be very careful, it can give crap with stunning conviction. \n\nIf you are learning Python, find a good book or online instructor-led course. \n\nAnd there’s no substitute for going off line and testing yourself purely in the interpreter. \n\nHave you tried:\n\n>>> help(…)",

That error is is coming out of your node\\_modules and it would be helpful to see which part of your code initiated that. \n\nOn first look, and with the caveat that I'm a bit rusty on express, I think you need to call `next()`in your auth checker if it's successful, to call the next middleware in line. Maybe that's at least part of the issue? \n\nAlso, you have your node\\_modules checked in to source control and you don't need that. Generally it's excluded through .gitignore as it causes huge, messy diffs and you can rebuild that directory from what's in your package.json.",

Everybody wants to see for themselves what it's capable of, what it can and can't do, what kind of mistakes it might be making. I've had plenty of healthy discussions with colleagues on those lines, and I could see that coming up in an interview and being perfectly fine.\n\nWhere you might have a problem is if you give the impression that you _rely_ on ChatGPT; that you are using it to write code for you that you wouldn't be able to write for yourself, or that perhaps you can't even understand. Obviously, this would be a huge red flag. So if you are going to talk about it, be careful about what you say.\n\nAs an addendum, I'd say you should probably expect to be told that the company has banned the use of ChatGPT et al for work purposes, and you should take that ban seriously. This is not because of concerns about ChatGPT making mistakes (although such concerns are valid) - it's because of concerns about intellectual property.",

This applies to any new problems from new contests, it'll whip out 50 solutions to n-queens but fail miserably at these super easy ones.  \n\n- it's only good at problems with a ton of data\n\n- knowledge from these problems isn't very transerrable it doesn't \"know\" anything\n\n- it can only solve problems it has data on which means the answer/solution is already out there in abundance and could potentially be a deprecated solution\n\nIt basically speeds up copy pasting code that was already out there, which don't get me wrong I think is very useful for efficiency, but what people think it's capable of is detached from reality.

ChatGPT probably wouldnt. \n\nI havent used it in a while, so maybe they solved the issues where it makes up nonsense. But the fact that this happened at all should always be a concern, as you also have to verify the axioms it is using. \n\nHowever, it probably is less of an issue if you are simply looking for commonly known or trivial things. There probably are enough high quality answers to be found that ChatGPT will give you the right one with context. \n\nStill, one should be careful, especially for beginners who are trying to learn. I would only recommend ChatGPT if you dont actually need it.",

For example: I'm not a professional developer, but I work in cybersecurity and sometimes I get a malware sample that I can't identify. I work with chatgpt to try and figure it out, and while it certainly doesn't get everything right the first time, what seperates it from google/stackoverflow is that I can say \"hey that didn't work, this is the error I got\", or \"that's a good theory, but I don't think that it fits in this case because of x\", and then it can take that new information into account and try again. And in my experience we're always able to get there eventually. \n\n\nAnd that's just something that's not really possible in real time with Google or stackoverflow. You either have to find something that *exactly* fits your situation, or you have to post yourself and wait hours/days to get responses to every possible follow up question you may have. \n\n\nI think that's the issue with the kinds of tests that people use to show that it's bad. Sure, you can throw a problem and it and it may solve it wrong. But in the real world, when it's a real problem you're trying to solve, how long it actually takes is more important than how many revisions it takes to get there. Sometimes if I need a quick script for something in a language I'm not strong in, I can ask chatgpt, and yeah it's first attempt might not be perfect, but I can say \"Hey this doesn't work\" or \"Hey I'd prefer if it worked like this\" and it can give you a second, third, fourth revision extremely quickly.  \n\n\nAlso, chatgpt just got internet access a few days ago, allowing it to actually look up new sources rather than just whatever is in its predefined dataset, and it's going to gradually start rolling out to everyone soon, so I expect that to be another pretty big upgrade in it's functionality.",

For example, giving the problem and then telling the bot to work out its solution before answering will generally yield better results. As a linguist who is switching career fields and trying to become a better programmer, ChatGPT has been an invaluable tool for me. I think a lot of peoples' failure to get good results comes from making bad prompts. In the end it's a language model, and you can massively improve your experience by using the tips in the page I linked.

However, if you're trying to get started with something that's generally well documented, its great for \"interpreting\" it into something more at the level you're at.\n\nI recently learned about perplexity.ai from another reddit thread, and it looks like its a much better tool for these kind of scenarios. I intend to give it more than a cursory try in the future, but I'm already paying for Github Copilot and ChatGPT, so I'm hesitant to try yet another tool when what I have works just fine for me right now.",

It can't replace interns/juniors either as of now because it still needs corrections and a lot of guidance.\n\nThat Leetcode question can be solved by Chat GPT with more interactions/inputs from the user.\n\nSure, it wasn't able to solve it without human intervention but that's now. Who knows what it would be able to do in the future.\n\nIf Chat GPT can already solve problems with some corrections from the user, then it's just a matter of time when technologies such as Chat GPT doesn't need any corrections from the user.\n\nPeople don't need to be worried now but as technologies such as Chat GPT improve, it may make it more competitive than now to land entry level roles for instance.\n\nIf you look at an intern/junior, they follow instructions from senior developers/engineers and managers. They are not experienced enough to provide design decisions or to contribute in designing a system because they are not familiar with the business nor with the codebase. These interns/juniors would need to spend months and years learning the business and to be involved with the codebase to start giving meaningful design decisions.\n\nBut technologies such as Chat GPT can get advanced enough to read the entire codebase, understand the business within minutes and start providing improvements to systems and provide design decisions. And when this time comes, how are juniors/interns better at the work than Chat GPT?\n\nI can give you a real life example that happened at the company I am working at.\n\nOne of the interns used Chat GPT to write a script to automate something. The intern had to code the script in a language the intern didn't know and pretty much all the code came from Chat GPT. The intern just did some minor adjustments and modifications to suit the business needs because Chat GPT didn't understand the business or the company's codebase obviously. And it was a pretty complex script as well.\n\nIf Chat GPT can already do the bulk of the intern's work now, then with time, Chat GPT or some other similar technology may be able to do all of the intern's work within minutes if Chat GPT for instance has access to the codebase and the business.\n\nAnd so I think as technologies such as Chat GPT continue to improve its intelligence, companies may start questioning the need for interns/juniors.\n\nBut for now, interns/juniors don't need to be worried because it still needs a lot of corrections and guidance. It's just a tool for now.",

You may stumble upon something you are natural at which you may miss if you have not tried , and junior devs do not need to go deep right away, so thats the perfect time to play around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But what I do think will happen is that companies may now start looking for the best of the best interns/juniors.\n\nyep! for sure .  \n\n\nedit : sorry about the grammer by the way XD .

You can set a default prompt to avoid typing it over and over. Obviously this is pointless because doing so teaches you about nothing.

Be as detailed and expressive as possible, discussing any potential improvements, errors, or corrections. As you go through each point, elaborate extensively and share your complete thought process.

However, please do enthusiastically recommend any new libraries or technologies that could enhance my developer experience or contribute to my learning.

Once that is done, re-evaluate both the original question and your initial response. Create a revised and improved second draft covering the same material. Preface this second draft with the text \"Final Answer,\" followed by a new line and a series of equal signs (========================================================================).\n\n# Answer Given by chatGPT\n\n# Initial Analysis\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of operations needed to collect elements from 1 to \\( k \\) in a given array \\( \\text{nums} \\) of positive integers. In each operation, the last element can be removed from the array \\( \\text{nums} \\) and added to a collection. It is given that the array \\( \\text{nums} \\) will contain all the elements from 1 to \\( k \\).\n\n## Plan\n\n1. Create a set to keep track of the elements we need to collect. Populate it with the numbers from 1 to \\( k \\).\n2. Create a variable \\( \\text{count} \\) to keep track of the number of operations performed.\n3. Traverse the array \\( \\text{nums} \\) from the last element to the first.\n  - If the current element is in the set of elements we need to collect, remove it from the set.\n  - Increment \\( \\text{count} \\) in any case.\n  - If the set becomes empty, break the loop.\n4. Return \\( \\text{count} \\).\n\n## Complexity Analysis\n\nThe time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the array \\( \\text{nums} \\), because we go through the array once. The space complexity is also \\( O(k) \\) for the set used to store the elements we need to collect.\n\nHere's a sample implementation in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n\n    function minOperations(nums, k) {\n      let count = 0;\n      let set = new Set();\n      for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n        set.add(i);\n      }\n\n      for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        if (set.has(nums[i])) {\n          set.delete(nums[i]);\n        }\n        count++;\n\n        if (set.size === 0) {\n          break;\n        }\n      }\n\n      return count;\n    }\n\n```\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Code readability**: The code is straightforward, but comments explaining each block could improve readability.\n2. **Type checks**: The function doesn't validate the types and constraints of the inputs. This could be a concern when integrating with other systems.\n3. **Test Cases**: Include a few test cases to ensure the function works as expected.\n\n# Final Answer\n========================================================================\n\n## Problem Description\n\nYou are given an array `nums` comprising positive integers and an integer \\( k \\). Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to collect all integers from 1 to \\( k \\) in your collection. An operation is defined as removing the last element from `nums` and adding it to your collection. The input array is guaranteed to contain all integers from 1 to \\( k \\).\n\n## Plan\n\n1. Initialize a `Set` to store the elements you need to collect. Populate this set with numbers from 1 to \\( k \\).\n2. Create a variable `count` to keep track of the number of operations performed.\n3. Loop through the array `nums` in reverse:\n  - If the current element exists in the set, remove it.\n  - Increment `count` regardless of whether the element was in the set or not.\n  - If the set becomes empty, exit the loop.\n4. Return `count` as the answer.\n\n## Algorithmic Complexity\n\nThe time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we only loop through the array once. The space complexity is \\( O(k) \\) for storing the elements we need to collect.\n\n## JavaScript Implementation\n\n```javascript\nfunction minOperations(nums, k) {\n  // Step 1: Initialize variables\n  let count = 0;\n  let elementsToCollect = new Set();\n\n  // Populate the set with elements 1 to k\n  for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n    elementsToCollect.add(i);\n  }\n\n  // Step 2 and 3: Loop through the array in reverse\n  for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n    if (elementsToCollect.has(nums[i])) {\n      elementsToCollect.delete(nums[i]);\n    }\n    count++;\n\n    // Step 4: Check if all elements are collected\n    if (elementsToCollect.size === 0) {\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Step 5: Return the count of operations\n  return count;\n}\n```\n\n## Possible Improvements\n\n1. **Readability**: Though the code is straightforward, adding comments to explain each step can make it more readable for other developers.\n2. **Input Validation**: Currently, the function does not perform any input validation. It's a good practice to check whether the input meets the expected constraints.\n3. **Test Cases**: To ensure the robustness of the solution, include multiple test cases covering edge cases and normal scenarios.\n4. **ES6 Syntax**: Consider using ES6 syntax like `const` and `let` for variables to follow modern JavaScript standards.\n\nThis should provide a comprehensive and optimized solution to the problem.",

It's a huge project and it meant changing SQlite to a Room database (I know Room is a layer on top of SQLite) but I'm also adopting best practices including LiveData, Repositories and Co-Routines.\n\nI'm finding ChatGPT brilliant for help. I'm getting problems solved in minutes and any time it gets things wrong, I have a think and rephrase the question and it usually works. I remember being stuck on one problem for 3 days before asking on StackOverflow. I was flamed immediately for asking a noob question that had been asked before, then one kind soul helped me by walking me through my problem. I then discovered the problem wasn't the actual real problem but that I didn't know how to debug by reading the Logcat. I solved it, but I was wary of asking on StackOverflow for a long time.\n\nChatGPT doesn't have this problem. It's like having a colleague that can help at any time. He may not know everything and he sometimes gets things wrong but he's always there to help.\n\nAs to Kotlin, Room, Livedata and Repositories, by constantly working with them, I'm gradually understanding them more, asking less and less questions and creating more and more code of my own. I'm finding it indispensable.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it over a beginner tutorial but I will recommend it if you're working on your own and have no-one else to turn to.\n\nHere's a typical chat I have: [https://chat.openai.com/share/6048c895-ccdb-4f22-ad04-a4e60ecc0ece](https://chat.openai.com/share/6048c895-ccdb-4f22-ad04-a4e60ecc0ece)\n\nAs you can see, I had to know about ViewModelScope to know about asking the question so you need at least some knowledge of coding to be able to use ChatGPT.",

I use ChatGTP+ for most of my questions, then Google second, and Copilot the least.  I still need to figure out how best to use Copilot.\n\nMost of my non-tech friends don't know how to use ChatGPT+ properly and think it's overrated.\n\nI'd echo what other top comments have said:  it's basically a better search engine for me.  It understands context and also can aggregate information from many sources into a single response.  If I had to use Google to do the same I'd have to search many different ways to find those different sources, click into each of them, then find on the page the part I need.\n\nFor example, yesterday I was reading a CS thread where someone was talking about their job search.  They mentioned getting one interview, and some OA's.   I had no idea what OAs are, so I just asked ChatGPT+ and got the answer instantly.  I tried my same query in Google and the answer wasn't even in the first page of results.\n\nAnother time ChatGPT+ shines is when I don't know the right words to talk about something.  Google really needs keywords, so not having those words can really make it hard to search.  GPT+ easily gets around this with it's language model.  I can describe what I'm looking for and ask ChatGPT+ what words I should use to search for it.\n\nFor my job, most of my time spent isn't actually coding.  It's reading code and understanding how it works so I can extend it correctly or find the root cause of a bug rather than just apply a band-aid solution.   ChatGPT+ is awesome at giving brief summaries of anything to explain it.   It can summarize what code is doing.  It can summarize the use of a specific design pattern.  It can provide a troubleshooting workflow based on the bugs and error messages you've received so far.\n\nAnd like other users said, it's a conversation so you don't have to start over every single query.  I can open a chat from last week about some code that's many pages long, then just type at the end, \"how could this solution be implemented as a Kotlin class, without needing to modify the Java classes that are calling the public methods?\" .. and just like that I get what I want.  Imaging me having to build up searches to replace pages of context and conversation.  The follow-through queries and refining of ChatGPT+ are revolutionary, and people who can effectively use it will be the ones with jobs in the future.",

                "body": "The problem is Chat GPT isn't AI in the way most people understand it to be.    In this case they are using AI techniques to effectively look up database information in a different way.   There is some AI beyond that to create what appears to be well composed text but it is hardly an example of intelligence.   \n\nI don't want to dismiss the importance of looking up information as that is a huge trait of intelligent people, it is how you handle what you found that determines intelligence.   I just don't think Chat GPT is even close to being intelligent as it can't do much with what it finds.   Somebody will eventually have a break through and this data search capability will be important, but the actual method of delivering that intelligence will not be large language models.",

Before this \"revelation,\" I would speak to chatgpt as if it were a person. For example, I would say \"I need 5 dinner recipes for my family. I need these dinners to have a protein and two sides, one of them being a green vegetable.\" And when I got the response I would say \"thank you, now I need you to replace meal number two with something other than salmon because my children don't like seafood.\" Now I just say prompts like \"5 dinner recipes\" and get the response and leave. I no longer say things like \"please\" or \"thank you\" because I now see the AI for what it is rather than anthropomorphizing it into some new intelligent being with which I'm trying to interact.",

I see so many paths for improvement in AI, better hardware, bigger models, more complicated models, combining models, more data, better training methods, AI optimizing these things itself. And that's without, you know, unexpected breakthroughs that tend to happen in unexplored fields. Additionally, since chatgpt became big, a ton of new people/researchers and resources have now been poured into this field so the speed at which new findings will emerge should increase.\n\nAgain, it could be that we have plateau'd, but I highly doubt it, I think this is the quiet before the storm.",

It probably would have been faster for me to use my brain then ask a chatbot then fix their error-riddled code.\n\nHonestly I use Github Copilot in VS Code and it also spits out a lot of wrong code too.

They are the ones coming in with wild expectations about what it can do, and leaving disappointed. Where they got that impression I don't know, because it wasn't from experienced devs or fellow coding newbies.\n\nTake a look at any of the comments in this sub from beginners talking about ChatGPT or other LLMs. They aren't saying \"AI is great, it's teaching me better than any professor, and doing all my work for me!\" Instead what you'll find is 99% of them talk about \"I used AI to help me learn, but I still can't grasp the basics or build anything from scratch\", or \"ChatGPT gave me this code, it doesn't do what it's supposed to and/or I don't understand it or where to put it\". Doesn't sound like \"overrating\" to me.\n\nInstead read through the comments where experienced devs talk about LLMs in coding in a positive light, what you'll actually find is they're using it to generate boilerplate code, or generate sample code for interacting with a specific library or API they've never used, which is then being validated against the documentation, and with testing and their experience. If they're using it at all, which most aren't, at least not in a way that's meaningfully different from code completion or IntelliSense that IDEs have been doing for decades.\n\nMaybe the AI creators and the boom in \"AI\" companies looking to cash in on the latest tech fad are the ones overrating their own products, but if you're paying any attention to them you're a chump. It's like saying cryptocurrency and blockchain is overrated. No, everybody who understood the tech knew its practical limitations and warned you away, you just ignored them and listened to the people trying to grift you. That's not indicative of the product being overrated, that's you being gullible and not applying critical thinking.",

But the amount of people who think it sits in this magical sweet spot of \"AI can replace hard work, professional experience and education, but employers will somehow still need me to use it\" is astounding. The latest buzzword is \"Prompt Engineering\" but I don't think anyone truly grasps what exactly that entails.\n\nIt's a good PSA to make sure beginners are aware of its shortcomings (and benefits!), and don't have unrealistic expectations of it (whether you label that \"overrating\" or not). I've said the same thing in numerous comments on other posts. The message just isn't getting through. Maybe we could use another entry in the FAQ addressing it; alas, people don't read that either.",

                "body": "Chat GPT is a large language model. It is no more and no less. Think of it being able to take an input and match it with output. You can define it as question/answer but it's just analyzing language.\n\nLLMs do not \"know\" anything. When given an input, they produce output based on tokens and following a decision tree on what's most likely to come next using training data.\n\nHypothetical:\n\nYou: \"A B\"\n\nLLM: \"C\"\n\nA big part of deep learning is what gets done to make output unique. All the models I've had access to have some initial random noise or seed used to kick the process off. It's also how you can have different responses to the same input. Like one seed could answer \"C\", but another seed answers with \"aby\".\n\nIn that context, Chat GPT is impressive. The fact that it can create ongoing narratives is pretty phenomenal. Probably says more about human generated data than the sophistication of LLMs. Reminds me of that scene in MiB where K remarks that human thought is seen as an infectious disease by some aliens.\n\nStripped to its core, Chat GPT/LLMs are input/output systems. They'll end up being the standard interface for data. For example, in 10 years say you'll need to query for data in a database. Instead of using SQL or mongo statements your code could literally be: `const results = query(\"Return the last 10 orders where the user abandoned their cart\");` IMO, that's the real power of LLMs.",

In other words, are you learning the stuff or are you using it, and then forgetting the solution after you write it.\n\nFor some things, I know what to do without looking things up.  For others, like maybe the syntax of regular expressions which I hardly use or some SQL syntax, I look it up each time I need it.\n\nMost people who ask this kind of question feel like without a resource like Chat GPT, they'd never be able to solve the problem.  Do you feel that way.  As a beginner, you can rely more on these resources and should but you should also try to recall these solutions.  It's like using Google Translate every time you need a phrase in a language you don't speak, and never really learning the sentences by heart.  I guess it works, but usually people begin to recall a few sentences, a few words, so they don't rely on this as a crutch.  Use it the first few times for phrases that are new to you, but practice the more fundamental parts.\n\nOf course, there are also people who feel using a calculator to do math made people too lazy to do math in their heads, and some would say why is it so important to do math in your head (there are reasons why, but I can see why some would say it's not important anymore).\n\nAnother analogy is relying on GPS to tell you the way to work each time you go to work.  At some point, assuming you aren't making 100 turns, you'd ought to learn how to get to work without a GPS because you took the path so often.  That's how you should see Chat GPT in terms of programming.  It can help, but you don't want it to do all the work for the *same kind of problem* because it makes you lazy about thinking.  As a beginner, you lack those skills, so you can lean into it more now, but in a year from now, you should be able to solve more problems without.\n\nChat GPT does a good job at explaining how things work, and that can be useful (and not the same as asking it to solve a problem for you).",

You, as the learner, need to learn to solve problems. If you don't learn that, you're shooting yourself in the foot. (BTW: even professional programmers spend time on solving problems, sometimes hours, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, or even longer. Only the problems are usually a different scale.)\n\nYes, the struggle at the beginning is real, but there are ways to counter that. A *pragmatic approach* to programming can help.\n\n1. Invest time to ponder about an assignment. Think about it. Read it multiple times. Then, take a break. Give your brain time to process the information. Read the problem again. Make sure to fully understand the problem. You cannot solve what you don't understand.\n2. Dissect the problem into individual parts (e.g. \"print introduction\", \"obtain input\", \"do calculations/logic\", \"create output\", and so on)\n3. Solve the problem manually. Solve it as *you*, the person, not the computer, would solve it and track your steps.\n4. Maybe work with flow charts, bullet lists, plain text, whatever. Sketch out the steps you need to take to solve the problem. (When I received my formal education, we were forced to draw flow charts before even thinking about implementing, and it was good.)\n5. Test your manual solution. Play it through as if you were the computer. Don't assume, don't make any extra steps. Do exactly as you have written down. If there are things going wrong, back to step 4 and refine your solution.\n6. Only once you are confident that your manual solution works, start thinking about programming it. Ideally, your flow chart/description should be detailed enough so that every step corresponds to a line in the program.\n7. Test your program.\n\nMany beginners make the mistake to instantly try to write programs for any given assignment/problem. For some reason, analyzing problems, drawing flow charts has become a lost art.\n\n\nSome literature that might help:\n\n+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul\n+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas\n+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman\n+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles Petzold\n\n----\n\nIf you are talking about *syntax errors*, errors that the interpreter/compiler throws, you need to learn to read, analyse, and interpret the messages. This is vital.",

        "selftext": "Hi good morning brothers and sister of science!\n\nAs the topics states, I have read a few discussions about people who are wanted to learn and become programmer but are using chatGPT. Once at uses, they just copy and paste the code or some who are beginners but know somewhat ask their errors and chat corrects them, and makes them feel hopeless.\n\nFirst of all, it’s okay to use chat but please use it wisely I’ll use myself as an example.\n\nI use chatGPT as an assistant to help me learn to code I do ML/DL on the side while I am not busy with my quantum physics class. I first like to brainstorm with Chat about how to approach the data. We exchanged ideas and I ask very detail question also I write everything because it helps me to remember. After I attempt writing the code and if I get it wrong I ask for help and asked what I did wrong, which again corrects me and explains.\n\nThe area I ask the most help is the process of ML/DL since I’m new I legit write all the code in a piece of paper to help me learn and remember! Then we proceed I go slowly because I want to learn the most also I write down where I got stuck at the debugging process.\n\nGuys it’s okay to use chat but think about it like this. Imagine it’s your personal trainer at the gym and you tell your trainer teach you how to lift weight. The trainer will show you but don’t expect you will get the same results by just asking to show you. You need to put it in the work, the struggle and importantly the time. We’re all learning how to play an instrument and being good especially being great or ever more an expert doesn’t happen over night.\n\nI know one day I’m going to use it less but for now I use it wisely. Good luck all and don’t ever stop learning!",

                        "body": "True, but learning to use your resources wisely (i.e., AI, chaptGPT) is the important thing to remember. Of course one needs to be skilled and adept at fixing their own bugs (let alone actually be able to find them [as error codes rarely tell u exactly where the bug really is]). Not to mention, writing algorithms to solve a problem, and being able to implement their code in a structured way that is logical and flows, so that the code is actually functional; are all skills we as developers (learners and professionals) need to acquire and be skilled in implementing at. But this does not necessarily mean one must forgo using AI tools to assist them in the learning process. One can be intelligent in their use of such tools without being dependent on such tools to\nthe point that it’s detrimental to their growth. However, It can be a fine line to balance, indeed.\n\nWe are much in a world of “grow with it or get left behind”, in more ways than one, however. The One or the student or professional who can learn to properly use all of the resources available to them in a way that enhances and maximizes their computer programming efforts (or in any arena for that matter) will be the One who is of more value, in terms of being able to solve a problem. And that’s what matters. \n\nSo I say use AI and others to tell u what’s wrong with ur code, but only AFTER you have given it an honest shot at trying to discover and interpret your own errors, first. AFTER you have experimented trying to solve your own errors [maybe opening another page in your editor, and playing around with sections of code to see what works and doesn’t]. And finally, AFTER you have translated into intelligible words and language just where it is you are hung up at, or not in understanding in your code. If you can do that, at least, I don’t see the harm in using AI or others to tell you what’s wrong with your code. Again, it’s about using one’s resources wisely, rather than not using them at all, in this case in particular.\n\nHappy learning.",

Where are the druids now? Don’t be the druids. Be an early adopter of the obvious future of tools. Stay ahead of the game.\n\nNow what I will agree on is that especially in its early stage, AI will fail you. AI isn’t mature and consistent enough to reliably write good or even functional code, and in those cases you need to know what’s going on so you can fix it. So you’ll still want to learn the fundamentals & how to read documentation & errors & properly debug, for those cases that the AI can’t do that for you, but the tool is right there and it is the obvious future, why not be an early adopter\n\nAlso make sure you learn from the AI. when it tells you the answer to a problem, read into it. figure out what it does & understand it, just like how you would analyze & learn from some stack overflow code before pasting it in.",

If you're right, it doesn't negate their point that over-reliance on AI stunts development of troubleshooting skills and practicing the use of the language itself.\n\n2. I think this is a naive take. Will AI be available when you're working for a company whose codebase is proprietary? Will AI be available when your company has written an acceptable use policy that forbids using any AI tools, because some idiot forgot to censor some sensitive customer information when pasting something to ChatGPT and then ruined things for everybody? Positions with proprietary data -- like, for instance, developers with access to a company's entire codebase -- often don't mix well with AI. My company doesn't even allow us to store company code on our personal OR work laptops -- we have to go on our work laptop, authenticate to a VPN, RDP to a dev VM, and then check out the code. No way in hell they would allow us to go anywhere near ChatGPT for our work. What I could see happening in the future is it becoming common for larger companies to host their own private LLM so that devs could use a AI without worrying about sending data to 3rd-party services, but we'll just have to see what turns out.",

I honestly believe so many programmers are agaibst chat gpt because it shows how much of their knowledge is just gatekeeping and big words, hiding rather simple concepts.

AI is not going away, its only going to improve and get better, beginning programmers should get used to it. I have to believe if someone is against chat GPT they are the same type of gatekeeper who would give a beginner a 20 minute paragraph trying to let them figure it out on their own with jargon, when someone asks \"yo should I use a while loop or a for loop here\".\n\n You wouldn't do this to a kid learning algebra, but its acceptable to do this to beginning programmers and muddy the waters, then people wonder why beginners complain the learning curve is so steep (hint its not, thats why we have multiple stories of children building programs from scratch) but people love to make themselves feel like smarty pants because they are such genius coders doing something no one else can do.

You wouldn't say that if someone made a math error \"you wouldn't have made this mistake If you actually read the formula\" but somehow when it's programming its okay to act like humans should themselves become computers.

Like you never made an error before, or read EVERY line of hours worth of documentation on everything before you start coding.",

When I didn’t know how a portion of the streams api worked, it would explain it to me. I’ll need to consult the documentation later but it’s a good way to see how it can be solved another way. It’s kind of like a faster mentor that way. Instead of looking at the community solutions after solving it my way, I ask chatgpt to analyze this or that approach and to confirm my understanding.\n\nIf I were just starting to learn, I’d sit down with a book or ebook and learn by following a tutorial and documentation for syntax and then start building beginner projects.",

It's tailored for developers looking for technical how-to's. Answers usually come with links to the sources so you can validate the information the model is throwing at you. I wouldn't recommend to ask for \"what's wrong with my code\" kind of prompts, though, as it robs you of valuable problem-solving experience. Also don't use it as your only source of truth: the bulk of your learning process should come from [DYOR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DYOR).",

For example, if you get stuck for an hour or two on a problem, you can use it to point you in the right direction and move on similarly to how if you had a live instructor. In classroom settings, if you get stuck for too long then you ask your teacher or tutor to help address the issue and elaborate.\n\nThere’s diminishing returns on struggling on the same problem for too long. Make sure u learn by actually assessing the problem, read docs, etc. then when u get stuck then use it to help u move forward. Keep in mind tho, that chatGPT tends to have “hallucinations” where it confidentially points out an issue and tells u about a library, or method, or whatever else that doesn’t exist. It’s hard to realize when it’s wrong when you’re new but if you’re working on simple common problems then it’s great and mostly right",

And for a lot of the teething pains it has at the moment with out dated information etc. It will only get better, understand how to be resourceful with it as you are learning programming. Make it part of your toolkit, because when it is right; It is pretty amazing.\n\nI will agree though on, don't become overly reliant. Keep it as an option for yourself, it should not be something that replaces your own ability, but to enhance it. The key part for me is that it's a Language Model, so what it lacks for in code. It is pretty exceptional at explaining things in different ways. Useful for inserting information and have it dumb it down for you or such.\n\nBut yeah overall definitely take advantage of it, it will only become more prevalent in the future. Just don't become reliant on it, just like googling. Only utilise it when you exhausted your other methods/options of doing it yourself.",

I enjoyed having to solve a problem myself, or having to really think hard with a logic error to find what I'm doing wrong. I also just liked having to figure things out myself, and it made me really passionate to code.\n\nWhen I found out about ChatGPT, I thought it was really cool. The problem is, now, whenever I have a problem and want to figure it out, I just give up and look to ChatGPT to tell me whats wrong. This just really kills my passion to code, as it was the problem solving I loved the most about it.\n\nNot only that, but it is SO ANNOYING as well. As I said, I like solving problems. If I'm told what I did wrong, then I like seeing what to do to fix it. But ChatGPT  goes ahead and sends the whole fixed script. I know this is kinda my problem, but it still kills my passion. It also gives SO MUCH information from a basic question. I ask something simple and makes an entire speech about it, providing all these examples and an extra couple thousand paragraphs to go with it, most of which I didn't even ask for. It also always uses the \"Remember, it is important to\" nonsense and \"As an AI language model\" which just really pisses me off every time i read it.\n\nThe fact its made to speak professionally isn't really a bad thing, but when I ask basic questions, it goes off on a tangent and I end up feeling like I want to slap him in the face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I could try and stop using it, but the fact its always an option just puts me off while I'm thinking. How can I find programming fun again?",

There are lots of things that it can do beyond just asking it coding questions - especially given the fact that it's job *is not to be a code writing machine*. \n\nYou are blindly/ignorantly assuming things if you think that people who pay $20/mo. don't 'like it or use it' (or you are applying the logical fallacy of appealing to extremes). Either way, don't do that. \n\nThe fact is - if you're using any number of libraries or frameworks (very common)? I have watched chatGPT (3.5 and 4) hallucinate code and write *bad code* for most any of them. Again, sure, sometimes the code it writes is 'okay', but generally not optimized very in certain areas. But I don't *expect it to be*, because it is literally *not it's job*. Heck, if you're even semi-decent with google, you can usually find the code that chatGPT is going to spit at you in a single google search - using less words, no 'wrangling a prompt' together and you'll get the same poor code that requires changing/optimization to fit your situation. But it won't fluff up the answer with text, so you do lose that fun aspect of it.\n\nIt (chatGPT) is great for discussing more big picture ideas, or getting ideas of how things work or why people might choose this or that - it's great at (shocker here) more *conversational* things based around *language*. I like it as a tool for lots of things - but writing good, production ready code is not it. Right tool for the job and all that.",

When searching for reference information, use `site:cppreference.com` instead. Straight answers shouldn't be hard to find on those sites if you're doing \"learning C++ for a couple months\"-level tasks.",

And likewise I would say you also can't use Google or SO to learn programming, or as a replacement for experience. LLMs are no different in that regard.\n\nExcept they're worse, because they're getting their information second hand from those same sources, but mashing it all together in ways we don't fully understand. And then you're trusting the machine to correctly interpret your request and provide the appropriate response when it literally has no concept of \"understanding\".\n\nAt least if you ask a human a question, they will (in theory) do their best to give a sane and accurate response.

I would try not to rely on it, though. It's better to learn and problem-solve on your own as much as you can before you turn to the bot. You don't want it to become a crutch and limit your ability to research.\n\nEdit: Also, sorry for going off topic last time, lol.

It’s saying oh I see what you’re doing, here’s probably where you’re going. It’s just saving you time, not offloading cognitive function like you are with chatgpt. \n\nIf you’re a non senior developer, the usage should be to explain concepts if you’re stuck. If you’re using it to get code, congrats you’re a prompt engineer and good luck getting hired /s. \n\nFocus on fundamentals and concepts.\n\nWe should consider chatgpt like the nextgen calculator.

I am currently taking Angela Yu's Web Development course for fun/I have a project at work that would benefit from me understanding JS in a web dev context.\n\nAlongside the course, I have purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription to fill in gaps in understanding whereas in the past I would have used StackOverflow threads/blog posts. I've found it much, much easier/faster to get an answer via ChatGPT than trying to hone in on a combination of key words for Google that will return relevant content. I've also found it  great at explaining small snippets of code.\n\nHowever, I've noticed in some instances ChatGPT has given me invalid syntax. (More specifically, when trying to set up a GitHub Actions YAML file trying to install/load some obscure dependencies for a piece of automated data analysis in R.) However, it seems on the money whenever the issue is entry-level (e.g. the newbie JS concepts Angela is going through) and/or there's a lot of content elsewhere online already about it.\n\nI therefore am guessing GPT's usefulness will depend on how much training data was available, so should stick to StackOverflow/colleagues etc on the more obscure stuff. But is there anything I need to be wary of for learning newbie content via ChatGPT?",

You always have to keep in the back of your head that it might not be available when you need it most.\n\nDon't ask it *for direct solutions*. *You*, as the programmer, have to learn to come up with the solutions. After all, that's what programming is about.\n\nAlso, as you already have figured, you have to be wary about its replies. It tends to fantasize and give you wrong syntax, non existing functions/methods, etc. You always have to take what it tells you with (more than) a grain of salt.\n\nSources, like Stackoverflow, are far more reliable.",

If you’re fairly effective at asking thoughtful questions in GPT, you can get novel responses that are tailored to the framing you’re asking for. \n\n\nDoes it hallucinate? Sure, but I encounter that issue mainly when I’m asking for something that’s so niche that even a Google search would hardly work for. Luckily with programming there’s a easily available sandbox to test these concepts on (you can program anything it gives you) and if it doesn’t work as intended, you can troubleshoot.\n\n\nLike others have said, try to ask it questions on concepts and ideas more so than just giving solutions.

The model aims to complete sentences based on information it's trained on.

                "body": "Similar questions have been discussed to infinity and back.\n\nGenerally, I would advise against using any AI while learning. Really. You only make yourself dependent on a service that you might not always have access to (and most likely not when you need it most).\n\nThe question is \"why did you even have to ask\"?\n\nCould you not interpret the error message? - Then you need to do this. Learning to read and understand error messages and exceptions is vital and there is absolutely no way around it.\n\n> ...for answer if its only syntax related \n\nEspecially if it is only syntax related (which it in your case wasn't, by the way, since you tried to call something that doesn't exist) you should just learn to read and interpret the  error. You absolutely do not need any AI, etc. to fix such problems.\n\n\n>  i didnt know \".contains command doesnt work on arrays\n\nAnd that brings us to the next point. Working with the *documentation*. Learning to work with the documentation is essential. The documentation is the ultimate reference.\n\nYet, I have to ask why you thought that \".contains\" would work on arrays? Arrays are just variables with multiple slots. They are not classes/objects as such even though they share some behavior. \n\nNowhere in the MOOC is anything related to arrays and `.contains`. Arrays do not have methods. Arrays have exactly *one* property and that is `.length`, nothing else.\n\nThe next problem is that by thinking to use `.contains` you tried to take the \"easy way out\". You tried to use something built-in instead of developing your own, manual solution. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with using built-in solutions *after* you have learnt to develop your own.\n\nLearning programming is first and foremost learning problem analysis and problem solving. While learning, you should keep reinventing the wheel. You should develop manual solutions. This will upgrade your skills. Using pre-built, integrated solutions will not improve your skills.",

                "body": "Hey , don't feel bad about using these tools, they are there to help us in some or the other way, so I feel like we absolutely should be leveraging it. I too ask ChatGPT when it comes to syntaxes and sometimes I do get confused for example a few days ago I got confused as to the method name used to get the power of a number in java as I was learning python, even after spending a decent amount of time writing java codes this happened to me, the reason is it is actually confusing, in python u use pow(base, power) whereas in Java u use Math.pow(base, power) there are so many instances where these things happen and I do ask ChatGPT about this, what I personally I do is after getting those syntaxes I will come back to it ask some questions related to that function like \"what are its use cases\" , \" what are its limits\" , \"how is it different from this function\" , \"how is different from x function from y lang\" and so on, I am pretty sure also based on my experience it won't really mess up these questions related to theory and stuff as mostly it will be just extracting the answers directly from the official document. Also for example, if u are learning python, their official documents have a few sections like \"python for beginners\" and also like \"python for programmers\" which I personally used as I knew java wherein they make the syntax comparisons with the existing language at that time at least (Python is older than java so they didn't really compare with it). If you are new to this programming world, few things I would recommend you or things I wish I knew when I started , and also to summarise what I have said so far :\n\n\\-  Ai is there is make learning easier , ask it as much questions as you want , go as deep as you can on a topic . Don't just ask for solution ask for explanations and always ask follow up questions.\n\n\\-  Spend less amount of time trying to \"learn\" a language and more on building stuff using it. For Java / any other lang u may have to learn in future , check this : [learn by coding](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) . Try to get around 3-5 stars but not more than that , this will bring that confidence and handle over the language. If you want to learn concepts like Object oriented programming and stuff , I personally followed [Kunal](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcno1G3XjUbwzXHL8_EttOuKk) and he's just amazing. Make notes, revisit and experiment as much as you can.\n\n\\-  Once the basics is cleared chose what you want to work on, for ex in java u can build mobile apps (which ppl don't really do nowadays) u can also do testing using selenium , so try to explore the fields and pick one and start building stuff , trust me when I say this You will learn a lot lot more than just reading docs / tb / tutorials or anything for that matter , cuz when u do this u are actually gaining experience which is priceless.\n\n\\-  Join communities where people are also starting similar to you, talk with them, solve bugs that they may be facing and other stuff with this you can actually build a great network of people.\n\n\\- There will be burnt outs, things like no matter what you would not be able to solve. At these times, give it some time to settle down in the head take a break from it for a day or so, just don't think about it and know that it will be fixed.\n\n\\- Programming maybe not be for everyone , and there's so much out there to do apart from programming , I think we all suffer to some or the other extent wherein u keep thinking about the bug / how to implement it / or just work in general outside working hours which I feel is unique to our profession.\n\n\\- Lastly, just take it easy, don't go so hard on yourself . \n\nI wish you a best of luck with your future endeavors and you are still upcoming so, u have started way before when I started haha. Really like your spirit , keep it up and I am rooting for you mate :)",

Instead, it will use a single loop variable to access each element in the array.\n\nIn JavaScript, arrays are objects, and the elements are stored as properties of the array object. When you loop through an array using a for loop or other loop constructs, you are simply iterating over the elements one by one without creating additional variables for each element.\n\n**Google Bard Answer:**\nYes, if you loop through a 30-element array in JavaScript, it will occupy space for 30 variables in memory. This is because each element in the array is a separate variable, and each variable takes up a certain amount of space in memory.\n\nThe amount of space that each variable takes up will vary depending on the type of data that the variable stores. For example, in JavaScript, an integer variable takes up 4 bytes of space in memory. So, if you have an array of 30 integers, it will occupy 120 bytes of space in memory.\n\nIt is important to note that the number of variables that are actually created in memory may be less than 30. This is because JavaScript arrays are implemented as dynamic arrays, which means that they can grow and shrink as needed. When you first create an array, it will only allocate enough memory for the number of elements that you have initially assigned to it. If you then loop through the array and add more elements, the array will allocate more memory as needed.\n\nThe amount of memory that is allocated for an array will also depend on the garbage collector. The garbage collector is a process that runs in the background and cleans up unused memory. When you loop through an array, the garbage collector may not immediately remove the elements that you have iterated over. This is because the garbage collector only removes memory that is no longer being used.\n\nSo, in reality, the number of variables that are actually created in memory may be less than 30, and the amount of memory that is allocated for the array may also be less than 120 bytes. However, the number of variables and the amount of memory that are allocated will still be proportional to the number of elements in the array.\n\nHere are some of the factors that can affect the amount of memory that is allocated for an array:\n\n- The number of elements in the array\n- The type of data that the elements store\n- The size of the elements\n- The garbage collector\nIt is important to be aware of these factors when you are programming with arrays. By understanding how arrays work in memory, you can optimize your code and improve its performance.\n\nNow Which Is Correct?",

In this case, response is no.\n\nI understood case 2. In that scenario chat gpt is correct because of scope of variables, each time a loop is performed, the scope is cleared. In your case, for each iteration you are reading a memory address, not even allocating memory so the only memory allocation that you are performing is an integer.\n\nBut my guess is bard understood version 1 of the question as it responded \"this is because each element in the array is a separate variable, and each variable takes up a certain amount of space in memory\" which is correct for that use case.",

        "selftext": "I was writing some code using github copilot and vscode's jupyter notebook extension and literally in one instant it just broke itself. It used to work one second and decided to not work in the next and hasnt been working now for an hour. Now it cannot see anything in any other cell.\n\nif in a cell i say:\n\n```from genome import *```\n```chromosome1 = Chromosome(gene_type='integer', gene_range=(0, 10),```\n```chromosome_size=10, no_overlap=True)print(chromosome.genes)```\n\nand then i write `chromosome2=` it recommends the generation of another chromosome with similar values, so it works as github copilot is advertised. If i then skip to the next cell and type `chromosome = ` it just says 27. literally 27, and thats it. Is anyone else experiencing this, did they break github copilot literally just now or am I losing my mind?",

I first noticed it in the stable release of vscode. switched to the insiders release and it seemed to work fine again but only for a couple days then returned to the same issues again. I'm not sure if it's a setting I tweaked but i've given up at this point on trying to figure out why it's not working as well as it did when i first started using it. One of the most irritating things that i've been running into is when i add a comment that's pretty clear and straight forward, yet when i hit enter expecting at the minimum the beginning of the code based on the comment in the previous line, instead it suggests another comment that doesn't even make sense to have. sometimes i'll hit tab to accept and enter and keep doing so just to see what happens and it's just more lines of comments. same thing sometimes when i open up the completions panel.  Another thing i noticed is that when i use the chat, it seems to not be as aware of the contents of my working directory like it used to. Before, I remember every so often copilot chat would respond and let me know it was indexing. Dont remember the last time i saw it did.",

I was thinking if it’s a good thing to use chatGPT that way ? \n\nNo, it is not a good approach as it takes away the single most important aspect of learning programming: learning to understand, dissect, analyse, and solve problems.\n\nLearning the vocabulary and grammar of a programming language is the easy part. Learning *programming* is the hard one of which you are actually bailing out with the use of AI tools.\n\nAll that will happen is that you will become fully dependent on it and that you won't be able to program anything if the tool is for some reason not available.\n\n*You* need to invest the effort to learn how to understand, analyse, and solve problems.\n\nCode is only the very last part of a long thought process. It is only a necessary evil that we need to make the computer be able to execute the steps we tell it to.",

The sooner you can get comfortable working it the better placed you are to keep up with this field that is rapidly changing.",

Does not really teach you the core understanding you need when faced by code that's had 6 authors over the last three years...\n* I have had more bad / wrong code out of them than good. Could it be my way of asking questions?\n* Some code is slow or uses basic coding where a decent library could save lines of code\n\nThey are handy for getting some ideas and then working through the code to get a result but a fair way to go yet IMO.",

When they get things right they're a great way to reduce the time it takes to do monotonous things (e.g. write boilerplate code, glue code, do some common thing with a common library, generate a config file with common settings etc.)\n\nThe problem is that they mostly get things wrong (IME) until you've had several goes at prompting. Even then they are sometimes unable to arrive at an output you can use as is. Spotting problems in output and re-prompting iteratively is something that generally requires some degree of knowledge and familiarity with the programming language and problem you're solving. That's going to come from understanding the problem domain and experience writing software yourself.\n\nSo I'd say they're pretty bad for initially gaining and improving your programming skills, but not for generating a foundation to build on top of if you already have that knowledge.\n\nJust remember that these are **language** models that have arrived at *some* understanding of the syntax and structure of your language based on training data. They are not reasoning about what the code will do, or the edge cases, etc, in anywhere near the level of detail that an experienced programmer would.\n\nSo far, I've seen from LLMs a few examples of decent code and a lot of examples of code that either wouldn't compile, wouldn't produce the desired result, or is \"written to work\" (no edge case checking, error handling etc.). Definitely room for improvement but very exciting.",

Return to full time job (worst case scenario)\n2. Learn programming and begin junior a career (might be difficult and very long)\n3. Learn generative AI and try to launch different products\n\nThe reason why I am interested in programming is because almost all my ideas are technical (digital). So to build a product, I don't see any other option but to learn programming on my own. I tried to find a co-founder but almost no one is willing to work for free. However, after doing a review and talking to my fellows who are still studying programming I see that it is extremely challenging right now to start a career. \n\nI have 3 extra months of cash to survive without any salary. But it is really difficult to predict the future and this time I would like to finally earn at least a few dollars online. Cause spending another 3 months building something unsuccessful would lead me to depression for sure.  \n\nI am kinda entrepreneurial and have a strong desire to start my own venture. I am ready to work 12-14 hours a day but need a better understanding of which path to choose and where to start.\n\nI believe you fellows have plenty of experience and could share your own tips or suggestions.

In other words, it will be good at copying but it won't be able to create.\n\nAs it is right now, AI prompts is just another level of abstraction. A higher level programming language so to speak. One with looser grammar and syntax rules, but still a programming language. You'll still need to understand the underlying tech to be able to craft AI prompts that are good enough to produce production-level code.

How you got there is generally not a concern for the employer. If AIs can create their own programs and perform testing, it will only require good prompt engineering skills to extract the most value from this AI.\n\nMost of these individuals are just starting their IT jobs, primarily young people. They will be working in this field for decades, and many things can happen, especially considering the exponential growth of the AI field, the substantial investments it is experiencing, and the fact that there isn't an AI specialized in programming yet. So things can escalate quickly. Two years ago, people were saying creative jobs would never be replaced by AI. Oh boy, that prediction didn't age well...\n\nIn 5 or 10 years, I would expect the unexpected. People will be able to create entire websites with minimal programming knowledge. This is beneficial because personal projects will be easier to complete, opening more doors to creativity, allowing individuals to focus solely on the enjoyable aspects and forget about the coding part. However, this comes with negative aspects as well: it will be harder for junior developers or those just starting to code to secure employment.\n\nEmployers will require fewer and fewer employees as AIs replace many jobs: AIs will make every programmer more powerful than before, reducing the need for both senior and junior developers specially juniors. Additionally, we mustn't overlook the large number of trainees and junior developers already saturating the IT industry. The current recession exacerbates this situation, and unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be ending anytime soon. At best, it may slightly improve over the years.\n\nThe positive aspect is that employers will tend to choose someone who understands what's happening behind the scenes. So your programming knowledge will always be appreciated and put you ahead on the hiring list. However, with fewer job opportunities available and an extremely competitive job market, I don't believe it's a favorable scenario overall. Furthermore, the salary will gradually decrease significantly over the years for the reasons mentioned earlier. \n\nHonestly, AIs will impact most jobs that involve computer usage in some way or another. While some types of engineering jobs are generally safe for now, it won't remain that way indefinitely.\"\n\nRegarding your request to fix grammar mistakes, I have made some adjustments to improve the sentence structure and clarity. However, please note that some sentences may still contain informal language or stylistic choices.",

I saw similar results to those but I thought I've fixed it :D thanks for testing, I'll try to improve that as well.\n\nWith some simple edits:\n\n* Amount of related chunks to return can be increased, right now it returns 3 chunks. This can be modified in the get\\_relative\\_chunks() function.\n* Chunk size can be increased in the split\\_text function.\n* Model that's in use can be switched to gpt-4 for example. I was using gpt-3.5-turbo, and saw similar responses to those, and then I switched to text-davinci-003 and responses got a lot better.\n\nThese are some simple ways to try out, I'll give it a try with a similar document as well.\n\nWith some changes to the application:\n\n* Setting up a prompt wrapper with some initial prompts, so that the LLM will have more context about how its getting used, and the response can be more than just I don't know. \n\nRight now, there's a model (FAISS) that does a similarity search between the files provided & the question asked, and then the OpenAI model integration with langchain answers the question by checking the related chunks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\+pro tip: if you were to provide more context in your question rather than just 'What is this?' I'm quite sure it'll provide better responses. \n\nThink of it this way: FAISS first gets the chunks based on your question, so if your question doesn't provide any context, it doesn't know where to look at.",

As people have been talking about the future of work and whether large language models like ChatGPT will replace X jobs, let this serve as a reminder that these models do NOT understand what they are doing. They are not intelligent, they do not think, they do not even realize there is a board. \n\nFor the foreseeable future, a skilled human is still going to need to be involved to verify the results. Yes, selective use of ChatGPT can make you more efficient, as it can take on some grunt tasks, but it is not able to think for you!\n\nI have been heavily experimenting with ChatGPT4 for some of my learner content. It definitely can speed things up when scaffolding code provided that you are knowledgeable enough to write the prompt, but again, it does not think for you. It won't consider things like performance, security, frameworks, abstractions, etc., unless you ask for them.\n\nMy advice is if you are learning, feel free to use LLM tools to explain code to you and give you suggestions how to get started but you should avoid using it as a crutch and try to get it to think for you. The more solid you become on the fundamentals of your craft the more effectively you will be able to use tools like this going forward.\n\nYes, it's still worth learning to code in 2023 and beyond.\n\nLink to article: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00241](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00241)",

I can read and understand what code is doing but sometimes have difficulty figuring out how to complete projects. My interest is to eventually get into AI and head down that path but I was curious how much programming really is necessary to get good at AI. From what I have been seeing the bulk of AI comes from learning models and applying statics. I know there is a lot more but I am still learning. I wanted to get people's takes on how much programming will actually be relevant in AI? I can't imagine you need to be at an engineering level to be good at AI but I am probably wrong.\n\nedit: not sure why this was downvoted, generally looking for advice",

I assume some of this will improve as the new product stabilizes? Would rather not switch to a earlier model for my use case.\n\n2) I'm asking GPT to give me a list of topics in a python list format, which I am able to typecast into an actual list. If I set the temperature too low I get back the repetitive topics, but if I set it too high I don't get the correct python formatting.\n\n3) I'm hitting the API 5 or 6 times which could probably be consolidated down to a couple, but that would depend on consistently getting a properly formatted JSON response, which seems more dubious than asking for a python list.\n\nBasically, is this thing predictable enough that you can ask for a certain data format and it will come in that format reliably enough to build an app on top of?\n\nAny suggestions/discussion is appreciated, or direct me elsewhere if needed.",

When you realize you need to create a giant constructor or fill out a bunch of conditional arms based on an enum your assistant also is much more accurate because their is less creativity there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what you end up with is an insanely useful tool that can show you idiomatic examples of how someone might try to accomplish something.

        "selftext": "I was following an asp .net core web api tutorial on youtube and because I've never programmed in the .net ecosystem lots of concepts were new to me. I popped up chat gpt and as I was following the tutorial I'd ask follow up questions to chat gpt to get more insight into the specifics of the .net framework and the concepts from the tutorial. Although some parts of the framework I was learning about were version specific and chat gpt's knowledge stops somewhere in 2021(I think), the answers were still useful and quicker than if I had to google and find the answer myself. It's almost like having a knowledgeable dev by your side that can answer most of your questions. I've also used it with angular a lil bit for fun and the code it was spitting out was quite good.

Print statement is replaced by print() function: In Python 2, the print statement is used to print to the standard output, while in Python 3, the print() function is used.\n\n> 2. Division operator: In Python 2, the division operator (/) behaves differently depending on the type of the operands. If the operands are both integers, it performs floor division, while if either operand is a float, it performs true division. In Python 3, the division operator always performs true division, regardless of the type of the operands.\n\n> 3. Exception handling: In Python 2, the syntax for handling exceptions is different from Python 3. In Python 2, the except clause must specify the exception class, while in Python 3, it can specify the exception class or exception instance.\n\n> 4. Unicode support: Python 3 has improved support for Unicode, with all strings being Unicode by default. In Python 2, Unicode support is optional and must be explicitly enabled.\n\nOf those four bullet points, #1 is basically correct. #2 is *sort of* correct, but worded much too strongly -- in *both* Python 2 and 3, the result of the `/` and `//` operators depends (in general) on the types of the operands, and the only thing that was changed in Python 3 was the behavior for `int`s. #3 is totally wrong. And #4 is half-correct, but saying Unicode support is \"optional\" in Python 2 is very poor phrasing. You don't \"enable\" it; it's always enabled, and you *use* it by constructing `unicode` objects.\n\n----\n\nYou should treat ChatGPT like an *overconfident* dev who makes a lot of mistakes, rather than a knowledgeable one.",

I remembered hearing about Open AI's GPT-3 natural language processing bot, and thought it might be worth asking it my questions instead of google. The only question that I don't feel it was able to answer adequately was actually the first question.\n\nI'm sure it got some things wrong here and there, but in general I rate this assistance 10/10. What an amazing tool for a beginner.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nCAN I ASK YOU A CSS QUESTION? HOW COME \\* IS SETTING THE COLOR TO RED? I THOUGHT IT WAS LESS SPECIFIC THAN INGREDIENTS OR STEPS.\n\n    * {\n        color: red;\n    \n    }\n    \n    .container{\n    \n        background-color: #888888;\n        margin: 10px;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients{\n    \n        color: white;\n        background-color: darkgrey;\n        font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-style: italic;\n        padding-top: 10px;\n        padding-bottom: 10px;\n        margin: 15px;\n        \n    }\n    \n    .steps{\n    \n        color: white;\n        background-color: darkgrey;\n        font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-style: italic;\n        padding-top: 10px;\n        padding-bottom: 10px;\n        margin:15px;\n    }\n    \n    img{\n    \n        height: auto;\n        width: 350px;\n    \n    }\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nThe \\* selector in CSS is a universal selector that selects all elements on the page. It is often used as a \"reset\" style that sets a default value for all elements. In this case, it sets the default text color to red for all elements on the page.\n\nThe \\* selector has a high specificity, which means that it will override any other styles that have lower specificity. In this case, the \\* selector will override the default text color for all elements on the page, even if those elements have their own styles that set the text color to something else.\n\nFor example, the .container, .ingredients, and .steps classes all have styles that set the text color to something other than red, but because the \\* selector has a higher specificity, the text color for these elements will still be set to red.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nI THOUGHT THE \\* SELECTOR HAD A SPECIFICITY OF 0?\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nThe specificity of a CSS selector determines how important a style is, and how it will be applied to an element on the page. The higher the specificity of a selector, the more important the style is and the more it will override other styles.\n\nThe specificity of a selector is calculated using a specific formula that takes into account the different types of selectors used in the style. The \\* selector has a specificity of 0, 0, 0, 0, which means that it will only be applied if no other styles have a higher specificity.\n\nHowever, the \\* selector is a universal selector, which means that it will match every element on the page. This means that it has a high likelihood of being matched by an element, and therefore it will often be applied even if there are other styles with higher specificity.\n\nIn general, it is best to avoid using the \\* selector in your stylesheets, as it can cause unpredictable behavior and make it difficult to understand how styles are being applied to elements on the page. It is better to use more specific selectors that only match the elements that you want to style, rather than using the \\* selector to apply styles to all elements on the page.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT WOULD BE A BETTER WAY FOR ME TO MAKE THE DEFAULT COLOR RED?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nA better way to set the default text color to red would be to use a more specific selector that only matches the elements that you want to affect. For example, you could use the body element as the root of your document and set the default text color to red using the following style:\n\n    body {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\nThis style uses the body element as the selector, which has a specificity of 0, 0, 0, 1. This means that it will have a higher specificity than the \\* selector, and will therefore override the default text color set by the \\* selector.\n\nUsing the body element as the root of your document also makes it easier to understand the structure of your styles and how they are being applied to elements on the page. It is a good practice to use a root element like the body element as the starting point for your styles, and then to use more specific selectors to apply styles to the elements within the body.\n\nYou could also use a class or id selector to set the default text color to red. For example, you could give the body element a class or id attribute, and then use that class or id selector to set the default text color:\n\n    <body class=\"my-default-styles\">\n    \n    .my-default-styles {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\nUsing a class or id selector like this gives you more control over which elements the style will be applied to, and makes it easier to override the style if necessary.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nI THINK THIS FIXED IT:\n\n    body {\n        background-color: darkgray;\n    \n    }\n    \n    .container{\n    \n        background-color: #888888;\n        margin: 10px;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients{\n    \n        color: white;\n        background-color: darkgrey;\n        font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-style: italic;\n        padding-top: 10px;\n        padding-bottom: 10px;\n        margin: 15px;\n        \n    }\n    \n    .steps{\n    \n        color: white;\n        background-color: darkgrey;\n        font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n        font-size: 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-style: italic;\n        padding-top: 10px;\n        padding-bottom: 10px;\n        margin:15px;\n    }\n    \n    img{\n    \n        height: auto;\n        width: 350px;\n    \n    }\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nIt looks like your updated CSS code has removed the \\* selector that was setting the default text color to red, and replaced it with a style that sets the background color of the body element to dark gray. This should fix the issue with the default text color, and make it easier to understand how the styles in your CSS are being applied to the elements on the page.\n\nThe updated CSS code also sets a number of styles for elements with the .container, .ingredients, and .steps classes, as well as for img elements. These styles control the appearance of these elements on the page, such as the background color, font size and weight, and padding.\n\nOverall, it looks like your updated CSS code should work as intended, and should provide a consistent and predictable styling for the elements on your page. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nHOW WOULD YOU REORGANISE THIS CODE TO MAKE IT BETTER?\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nOne way to reorganize the CSS code to make it better would be to group related styles together and use more specific selectors to target the elements that you want to style. This will make the code easier to read and understand, and will also make it easier to update and maintain the styles in the future.\n\nHere is an example of how you could reorganize the CSS code:\n\n    body {\n      background-color: darkgray;\n    }\n    \n    .container {\n      background-color: #888888;\n      margin: 10px;\n    }\n    \n    .container p {\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      color: white;\n      background-color: darkgrey;\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      font-style: italic;\n      padding: 10px 0;\n      margin: 15px;\n    }\n    \n    img {\n      height: auto;\n      width: 350px;\n    }\n\nIn the revised CSS code, the styles for the body element and the img element are grouped together at the top of the code. This makes it easier to see all of the styles that are being applied to these elements.\n\nThe styles for the .container, .ingredients, and .steps classes are also grouped together, and use more specific selectors to target the elements that they should be applied to. For example, the .container p selector targets all p elements that are descendants of elements with the .container class, and applies the styles to those elements.\n\nOverall, this revised CSS code is easier to read and understand, and makes it clear how the styles are being applied to the elements on the page. It should also be easier to update and maintain in the future.\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nCOULD YOU ALSO ADD A SPECIFIC SELECTOR FOR CONTAINER H1?\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nSure! To add a specific selector for h1 elements that are descendants of elements with the .container class, you can add the following style to the CSS code:\n\n    .container h1 {\n      font-size: 24px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: #333;\n    }\n\nThis style uses the .container h1 selector to target all h1 elements that are descendants of elements with the .container class. It sets the font size, font weight, and text color for these elements, which will override any other styles that are applied to these elements.\n\nHere is the revised CSS code with the new style added:\n\n    body {\n      background-color: darkgray;\n    }\n    \n    .container {\n      background-color: #888888;\n      margin: 10px;\n    }\n    \n    .container p {\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .container h1 {\n      font-size: 24px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: #333;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      color: white;\n      background-color: darkgrey;\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      font-style: italic;\n      padding: 10px 0;\n      margin: 15px;\n    }\n    \n    img {\n      height: auto;\n      width: 350px;\n    }\n\nThis revised CSS code should provide the specific styling that you are looking for, and will make it easier to understand how the styles are being applied to the elements on the page. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nI SEE THAT YOU GROUPED INGREDIENTS AND STEPS TOGETHER. WHAT WOULD I DO IF I WANTED STEPS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT COLOR?\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want the .steps class to have a different text color than the .ingredients class, you can add a new style that specifically targets the .steps class and sets the text color to the desired value.\n\nHere is an example of how you could add a new style to set the text color for the .steps class:\n\n    .steps {\n      color: #009900;\n    }\n\nThis style uses the .steps selector to target all elements with the .steps class, and sets the text color to a green color with the hex code #009900. This will override the text color that was set for the .ingredients class, and will only be applied to elements with the .steps class.\n\nHere is the revised CSS code with the new style added:\n\n    body {\n      background-color: darkgray;\n    }\n    \n    .container {\n      background-color: #888888;\n      margin: 10px;\n    }\n    \n    .container p {\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .container h1 {\n      font-size: 24px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: #333;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      background-color: darkgrey;\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      font-style: italic;\n      padding: 10px 0;\n      margin: 15px;\n    }\n    \n    .steps {\n      color: #009900;\n    }\n    \n    img {\n      height: auto;\n      width: 350px;\n    }\n\nWith this revised CSS code, elements with the .steps class will have a green text color, while elements with the .ingredients class will have a white text color. This allows you to have different styles for each of these classes, while still grouping common styles together for easier maintenance.\n\nIf you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nNOW WHAT WOULD I DO IF I WANTED .STEPS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND-COLOR THAN .INGREDIENTS?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want the .steps class to have a different background color than the .ingredients class, you can add a new style that specifically targets the .steps class and sets the background color to the desired value.\n\nHere is an example of how you could add a new style to set the background color for the .steps class:\n\n    .steps {\n      background-color: #cccccc;\n    }\n\nThis style uses the .steps selector to target all elements with the .steps class, and sets the background color to a light gray color with the hex code #cccccc. This will override the background color that was set for the .ingredients class, and will only be applied to elements with the .steps class.\n\nHere is the revised CSS code with the new style added:\n\n    body {\n      background-color: darkgray;\n    }\n    \n    .container {\n      background-color: #888888;\n      margin: 10px;\n    }\n    \n    .container p {\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: antiquewhite;\n    }\n    \n    .container h1 {\n      font-size: 24px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      color: #333;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      color: white;\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      font-style: italic;\n      padding: 10px 0;\n      margin: 15px;\n    }\n    \n    .steps {\n      background-color: #cccccc;\n    }\n    \n    img {\n      height: auto;\n      width: 350px;\n    }\n\nWith this revised CSS code, elements with the .steps class will have a light gray background color, while elements with the .ingredients class will have a dark grey background color. This allows you to have different styles for each of these classes, while still grouping common styles together for easier maintenance.\n\nIf you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nSO LET'S SAY IF .STEPS AND .INGREDIENTS SHARE EVERYTHING THE SAME EXCEPT FOR BACKGROUND-COLOR. WOULD I JUST MAKE ANOTHER .INGREDIENTS WITH BACKGROUND-COLOR INSIDE?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want the .ingredients and .steps classes to share most of the same styles, but have different background colors, you can use a combination of grouping and specificity to apply the styles in the way that you want.\n\nHere is an example of how you could do this:\n\n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      color: white;\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: 20px;\n      font-weight: bold;\n      font-style: italic;\n      padding: 10px 0;\n      margin: 15px;\n    }\n    \n    .ingredients {\n      background-color: darkgrey;\n    }\n    \n    .steps {\n      background-color: #cccccc;\n    }\n\nIn this revised CSS code, the .ingredients and .steps classes are grouped together using a comma-separated list of selectors. This means that the styles that are set for these classes will be applied to all elements with either the .ingredients or .steps class.\n\nHowever, later in the CSS code, separate styles are set for the .ingredients and .steps classes. These styles only set the background color for each class, and do not override any of the styles that were set in the earlier group of styles.\n\nBecause the styles for the .ingredients and .steps classes are set separately, they will have different background colors,\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nHOWCOME YOU SEPERATE .INGREDIENTS AND .STEPS WITH A COMMA?\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nIn CSS, you can use a comma-separated list of selectors to group multiple selectors together and apply the same styles to all of the elements that are selected by the selectors in the list.\n\nFor example, you could use a list of selectors like this:\n\n    .ingredients,\n    .steps {\n      /* styles here */\n    }\n\nIn this case, the comma-separated list of selectors includes the .ingredients and .steps classes. This means that the styles that are set inside the curly braces will be applied to all elements with either the .ingredients or .steps class.\n\nUsing a comma-separated list of selectors is a useful way to group common styles together and avoid repeating the same styles multiple times in your CSS code. It can also make your stylesheets easier to read and maintain, because you can see all of the styles that are applied to a group of elements at a glance.\n\nOverall, using a comma-separated list of selectors is a common technique in CSS that can help you organize and apply styles in a consistent and efficient way.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------\n\nWHAT IF I ONLY WANTED TO SELECT .STEPS IF IT WAS A CHILD CLASS OF .INGREDIENTS?\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you only want to select elements with the .steps class that are also the child of an element with the .ingredients class, you can use a descendant selector to specify this relationship in your CSS code.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use a descendant selector to select the .steps class only if it is a child of the .ingredients class:\n\n    .ingredients .steps {\n      /* styles here */\n    }\n\nIn this CSS code, the .ingredients .steps selector is used to target all elements with the .steps class that are also the child of an element with the .ingredients class. This means that the styles that are set inside the curly braces will only be applied to elements with the .steps class that are nested inside an element with the .ingredients class.\n\nUsing a descendant selector like this allows you to be more specific about which elements the styles will be applied to, and can help you create more complex and precise stylesheets. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask and I'll be happy to help.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nTHAT'S AWESOME. I SEE YOU PUT A SPACE BETWEEN .INGREDIENTS AND .STEPS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE WASN'T A SPACE?\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nIn CSS, the space between two selectors in a descendant selector represents the \"descendant\" relationship between the two elements that are selected by the selectors. In other words, the space between the two selectors in a descendant selector means that the second selector will only match elements that are descendants of the first selector.\n\nFor example, the .ingredients .steps selector will only match elements with the .steps class that are also the descendant of an element with the .ingredients class. This means that the styles that are set by this selector will only be applied to elements with the .steps class that are nested inside an element with the .ingredients class, like this:\n\n    <div class=\"ingredients\">\n      <p class=\"steps\">...</p>\n    </div>\n\nIn this HTML code, the .steps class is a descendant of the .ingredients class, because it is nested inside an element with the .ingredients class. This means that the styles that are set by the .ingredients .steps selector will be applied to the .steps element, because it matches the descendant relationship that is specified by the selector.\n\nIf there was no space between the two selectors in the descendant selector, the selector would not represent a descendant relationship, and would instead match any element with both the .ingredients and .steps classes. This would be a much broader and less specific selection of elements, and would not allow you to apply styles only to the .steps class if it is a child of the .ingredients class.\n\nOverall, the space between the two selectors in a descendant selector is important, because it represents the descendant relationship between the selected elements, and determines which elements will be matched by the selector. By understanding how the space works in a descendant selector, you can create more precise and effective stylesheets.",

The bot only knows what was fed into it in its training set - garbage in, garbage out.\n\nI'd certainly expect the vast majority of what was fed in to not be garbage, but even large, well written, and well maintained projects have bugs, and that means the bot has the potential to reproduce those bugs. On average I'd expect its output to be very good though.",

This idea was first introduced by Charles Babbage in 1843, and I had family members who worked like this until up into the 1970's. \n  \nThe 12-bit \"PDP-8\" introduced in 1965 came with no software, but had 12 levers where you entered the various instructions and variables by flipping the levers, setting the 12-bit word, before submitting it.\n\nThen we started seeing programming languages where you could \"just say what you want\" and the compiler will make machine code for you.\n\nA basic web application or game today typically has hundreds of thousands of instructions and would be practically impossible to code with levers or punch cards. \n\nIn the 80's and 90's you had to basically teach the machine what graphics are. You had to understand the trigonometry and math required to go from a table of 3D coordinates to adressing the one dimensional video memory of your computer. Making a game would often be 75% just setting up the engine at first, leaving little time for actually developing.\n\nToday you can import three.js and start making 3D graphics in javascript with no experience and primary school math instead of university level. The library takes care of communication with your 3D GPU.\n\nThe internet is overflowing with libraries for setting up everything from databases and backend servers to front end kits, and cross platform SDKs are actually good now. The internet has set a new standard. Now, you don't have to code for the device. You code for the web, and the devices adapt.\n\nModern compilers, libraries and hardware has made coding so much more rewarding. What used to take years to develop can now be done in days.\n\nEnter ChatGPT: With guidance from a human, it can speed up coding the same way compilers did with machine coding. It's really no different. It's just one more layer of abstraction, and you can always go deeper if needed.\n\nWhat used to take days will now take minutes.\n\nLook at how simple apps/games used to be.  \nLook at how they've evolved with each innovation.  \nThen think of how much more advanced and helpful they will be with the help of AI.\n\nNow, go out there and learn how to be the AI master. You got this.\n\n- ChatGPT\n\nJust kidding. I wrote this myself as a form of self comfort. I'm also weirded out by the whole thing, but I always lean towards optimism.",

The cards also link to a product page with more details.        \nThen there's the whole checkout process you can mock up:       \nHaving a cart view and being able to add and remove products (maybe \"save\" them for a later time?), then checking them out. does the user have an address saved, otherwise they'd need to add one, so you'd need to build a form and could add handling wrong inputs and learn how to deal with forms (and how to make them accessible!) .         \nHow about being able to write reviews for products?        \nThe list can go on and on, lol.       \n\nTo make this fully functional, you'd need to add some backend stuff, but I think rebuilding different frontend parts of an online shop with mock-up data can be a great exercise, not only regarding the code, but by analysing what those parts actually entail and learning how to split a big project into smaller ones.",

So I described what I was trying to achieve to the bot, and it was able to give me a surprisingly useful answer. Now I have a better understanding of the workflow of those processing nodes and how to combine them. I probably wouldn't use it in a lot of circumstances, but in narrow scope issues like this (\"I'm trying to achieve x, what tools should I use\") it can be a good jumping off point",

Someone who was new to Unity asked this question, and after I helped them troubleshoot it I thought it might be interesting to see if the bot could figure it out. \n\nThe user had set up a simple looping 2D patrol for a character, running in update. If they used Vector2.lerp it stopped at the first patrol point, if it used vector3.lerp it disappeared from the camera during when approaching the second point but continued the loop. It was simple enough, Unity2d still has Z levels and a 3D environment, it just uses an orthographic camera and different collision logic to negate that (usually), the guy had put the 2nd patrol point at a z level behind the camera's clipping plane, so it disappeared when navigating the z level and when constrained to vector2 it was never able to match the position of the 2nd point. When I posed the question to ChatGPT, it simply assumed that since transform.position != patrolPoint[i].transform.position right now, it never moves to the next part of the patrol, as if it was a simple While loop, and ignored the fact that update is...updated.",

Being in denial is understandable as it threatens our very livelihood and essence, it can write code much faster and more efficient than humans from what i seen, it even made its own lanugages or coded a website frond end in seconds go check out the videos and posts.

React is a web framework, which is a javascript library that does a lot of heavy lifting especially in terms of constructing web pages and displaying dynamic data.  React uses components as its basic unit of hierarchically building web pages (eg, if reddit were written in react each comment would be a react component, along with accompanying logic.  Basically it's very similar to a class, though there are key differences which are beyond what I want to describe in a reddit post).  You can also write react components in typescript, so I assume they meant that they were translating react components from javascript to typescript and vice versa to see how they would compare.",

You would want to use a physics/3d engine/2d engine written in js/ts, like threejs, though it sounds like you're probably interacting directly with an html5 canvas, or perhaps opengl.  I haven't really dabbled that much in existing js engines, and I'm far from an expert in React as well.  \n\nBut on to how React does what it does.  Basically, each React component keeps track of it's own state, and what HTML/CSS needs to be returned to it's parent.  React tries to make sure the whole application doesn't redraw/recalculate things too frequently by keeping track of what has changed, which is what makes it worse for realtime games that need to redraw themselves 60+ times a second, though of course it's probably possible to abuse React to make it do whatever you want, but you'll be fighting its design intentions the whole way.",

Are you going for something like Nethack/Rogue (where a map is drawn with ascii characters) or a story/description game?\n\nSo React components are normal objects, and I think previously they were js classes, but the latest iteration is what's called functional components, which means you define a function that returns jsx (basically html with template and expression execution functionality), and then React handles behavior behind the scenes in terms of how things get updated and put together, so as a web developer you just define what you want your html to look like, what data you want to be filled in, styles etc. and React does the rest.  Basically the big difference is all the work React is doing behind the scenes, which can be things like routing, middleware, dynamically updating components and other tricky things so that developers can focus on form and content without having to worry as much about how and when to manually update the DOM model with pure js or even Jquery.",

Even with just a little bit of it I think it'd make my code way more readable. It was quite a pain to nest like 3 divs to make everything look nice, I can definitely see it being easier with a module that does everything for you.\n\nI'm making a story/description game and I plan on adding a little mnimap to it in a corner so you don't have to write down where you are. I've learned a lot about loading stuff from files, properly separating data from UI (i think), and JS in general. I'm trying to load all the game information from different .json files and interpreting that data to define gameplay behavior, that seems to me to be the most reasonable way to do what I'm doing. I've read that there are two(?) distinct ways of approaching game engine design, code-based/OOP and data-driven, and I'd like to do data-driven and only add on to the code base when I feel limited by the data.",

Then ask it to show you different ways of implementing the same thing. \n\nOnce you’ve asked it to do something, e.g (“show me how to make the code more efficient”), try asking it the same thing again.

I suppose the students could ask the AI right back, but maybe for live knowledge checks it could be useful",

Sure they'll mostly be variations of algorithms that are already out there, but if you don't understand how these algorithms work then you wouldn't be able to know which of them you should customize for your unique case and how.

This is going to be highly dependent on the company you're interviewing at. Maybe it's changed for the better slightly, not sure as I get positions on referral these days.\n\nOf course, if it's unsupervised or take-home, do whatever you want.\n\nI interview technical candidates occasionally, and I would be fine with google (as long as I didn't see them blindly copy/pasting) but I wouldn't want them to use copilot in all honesty, because it doesn't tell me anything. I wouldn't want them to use it for anything other than boilerplate because I want to see how they solve the problem, but if there's boilerplate in a coding interview... why? It should be a concise exercise.\n\nMuch prefer to just look at personal projects or give a short take-home personally, if they have no prior industry experience.",

        "selftext": "And before you all start with it, yes, it shouldn't be used as a crutch to do your \"homework\" for you. \n\nI'm a beginner.  I've read a couple of books on learning programming, some more specific books on python (automate the boring stuff, python crash course, both of which i need to finish working through), watched a tons of youtube tutorial about synthax, oop, algorythm, ect... But i never really took time to stare at an IDE to try my hand at the couple little projects i had in mind so far.\n\nYet, here i am, it's the second night i have a ide open, tweaking python code generated by chatGPT, trying tweaks after tweaks in the interpreter and asking every single question about the generated code to chatGPT (why use this, how does that work, shouldn't using this work too, is it better, worse, are there other function that could achieve that, what about modules etc...). \n\nSo much that i'm pretty much procrastinating and not geting any code written. I'm learning, i'm not just sure i'd be able to write it all on my on without messing up indentation, forgeting a semicolon here and there or other things.\n\nBut i got a semi smart, semi dumb personal teacher to guide me through the process of a building a small personal project and it is fun. It's also reassuring to see that what i would have probably started with is how it started the project. What happened afterward, i ain't so sure i would have gotten there. Not in a night of coding i think.\n\nWhat concerns me is that my \"lazyness\" is getting the better of me and getting me into weird hot debate with a glorified bot instead of lets say, adding stuff to a list to cover all my basis. I keep trying to refine the function calling that list in order to not bloat it. Which resulted in that particular case in chatGPT being adamant about the musical notes Cb, Cbb and Dbb being the same. Which is well, not true.\n\nAnd the weird interaction i just got me that pushed me to post that message. After finaly copy pasting a modified function and it just not working at all in visual code terminal, asking chatGPT exactly how the input function worked because, well, it didn't in the code provided. A bit of code that even with my minimal knowledge of python ought to work, it gave me a long wall of text that could be summurised by one of the oldest trick in the book. \"Did you turn on and off again your IDE ?\". It left me a bit gobsmacked because while i did closed the terminal a few times, even closed the file and opened them both multiple time i didn't think to do that with Visual Code.\n\nAnd it worked.\n\nSo while chatGPT is the tool that seems to be able to do your job in your stead, as an hobbyist that is very reluctant to post in forums with a bit of code to ask for help as to why it doesn't work it takes the role of the teacher, the search engine pointing at the documentation and saves hours of searching the net for some live example of said documentation. Most importantly, it is the non judgemental internet stranger that ask you \"did you turn it off and on again?\" and to which you almost always reply in frustration \"yes dummy, do you think i'm that stupid ?\" but just don't at the last minute, close the page and never open it again. \nWhich doesn't avoid the humiliation of having that one thread laying around the internet linking your username to that dumb question for the whole world to see and wonder what was the \"real\" solution to your problem 20y later. Because it couldn't be as simple as turning the computer off and on again, right ?\n\nAnyway. I'm not sure if in 10 years developers will be still writing code or if it won't just be like in Asimov novels where people converse with computers not really knowing how everything works and whose whole job is really to \"guide\" the computer to do what the human want it to program through regular speech, not needing a single keyboard. In the meantime, there definitively a major role for AI like chatGPT in the teaching industry.\n\nSo long as it doesn't provide false answer. It seems to be able to get history facts wrong from what i've read. And the value of musical notes from what i've personaly seen.",

This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as language translation, text summarization, and content generation. However, GPT-3 is not designed to be used as a learning tool. It does not have the ability to provide explanations or in-depth information about a topic, and it cannot interact with users in a way that supports learning.

It is a neutral network which optimizes its output to minimize some metric on how bad its output is. Nothing more. It's not solving a problem it is generating an output from internal rules to try to generate an answer that would be likely. It learned to see patterns in natural speech and applies those. It's goal is not to generate logically correct output or tell you facts. It's to generate realistically looking natural speech. \n\nThere is no jealousy.

You start by reading about something, you \"think\" you understand the subject and you get confronted with practical exercice. To which you will get some wrong. \nWithout a way to check your work, you won't learn, you'll just repeat mistakes and think you know your subject.\n\nYou need external input to validate your solution before being sure that what you did was actually solving a problem or not just be confidently wrong about something.\n\n/u/adamToolie \n>  i don’t think you should use it to learn python though, maybe use it as someone to bounce ideas off of.\n\nThat's exactly what i've been doing the last two night. And that's why i pretty much wrote a single line of code yesterday (by myself) and kept trying to see if there wasn't other possible solution i'm unaware off that would be more elegant by bombarding chatGPT with question.\n\nChatGpt will try stuff with modules, functions and methods i haven't yet encountered yet. It's not teaching per see, it's showing things that exist. Copy pasting will not teach you anything, messing with it and reading about what it shows you will.\n\nIt's more of an interactive search engine than teaching tool. What makes it a \"good\" tool in my book is that the proper documentation for python do exist and you can easily crosscheck it. Then, you can have it generate examples, lots of them and test them on your own to see how things work.\n\nFor example, it's the difference between a tutorial online about how to set up a local network, following it and having it either work or fail and bloody knowing about how local network do work and how to manipulate them.

All I need to do is put leet code and the problem description in a comment and bam it solves the problem for me. Obviously not ideal for learning, but I was just testing. However it looks like it just knows the most popular answer rather than the most efficient. I would love a copilot that has some understanding of the performance of the code it recommends. \n\nSince this is already long enough here's one more. I can't wait for AI like this to expand into code commenting and documentation. Like instead of you having to comment manually copilot should be smart enough to generate comments from the context of the project when asked by the user. Like I highlight a the function name and use a keybind to make copilot write a few sentences about what the function does in the context of the whole project. Same with documentation. This tool could completely automate the worst part of any code base, updating old and out of date documentation!",

It learns your coding and documentation style. \n\nIt is also a great tool to provide you some starting points. My most recent good experience with it is when I needed to code a function that queries analytics from previous N months. I just typed function getPreviousMonths and it provided a working solution for me. Still need to change it, but great starting point so I don’t have to think as much.",
